It works for me\nand for what I am doing.\n\n## Usage\n\n    var digest = require('http-digest-client').createDigestClient('username', 'password');\n    digest.request({\n      host: 'hostname.com',\n      path: '/path.json',\n      port: 80,\n      method: 'GET',\n      headers: { \"User-Agent\": \"Simon Ljungberg\" } // Set any headers you want\n    }, function (res) {\n      res.on('data', function (data) {\n        console.log(data.toString());\n      });\n      res.on('error', function (err) {\n        console.log('oh noes');\n      });\n    });\n\nThe digest client will make one reques to the server, authentication response\nis calculated and then the request is made again. Hopefully you will then\nbe authorized.\n\n## Writing to `req`\n\nI haven't yet figured out a way to write data to the final `req` object.\nMainly because I haven't really needed it. Feel free to suggest solutions! :)\n\n# License\n\nSee LICENSE.\n\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2012-11-22T07:54:51.999Z","modified":"2014-01-24T12:57:54.347Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"simme","email":"hi@iamsim.me"},"owners":[{"name":"simme","email":"hi@iamsim.me"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-digest-client","_npmUser":{"name":"simme","email":"hi@iamsim.me"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.14","_rev":"1-43edad71ca15efe557e79b261db44523","author":{"name":"Simon Ljungberg","email":"hi@iamsim.me"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/simme/node-http-digest-client/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Paul Gration","email":"pmgration@gmail.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"78e018f5c0756bc74d9a3ea4fe20ad6fdbc6af24","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-digest-client/-/http-digest-client-0.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"simme","email":"hi@iamsim.me"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-01-24T12:57:54.347Z","created":"2012-11-22T07:54:51.999Z","0.0.1":"2012-11-22T07:54:54.070Z","0.0.2":"2012-12-31T09:56:52.101Z","0.0.3":"2014-01-24T12:57:54.347Z"},"users":{"charles-cai":true}}}
