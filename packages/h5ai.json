If you are still using one of these versions you are advised to\nupgrade.\n\n## Install\n\nDo **not** install any files from the `src` folder, they need to be\npreprocessed to work correctly! Find a preprocessed package and detailed\ninstall instructions on the [project page][web].\n\nIn short you have to take the following two steps:\n\n* place folder `_h5ai` in the document root folder of the web server\n* append `/_h5ai/public/index.php` to the end of the default index-file list\n\n\n## Build\n\nThere are installation ready packages for the latest [releases][release] and\n[dev builds][develop]. But to build **h5ai** yourself either `git clone` or\ndownload the repository. From within the root folder run the following\ncommands to find a fresh zipball in folder `build` (tested on linux only,\nrequires [`node 4.0+`][node] to be installed).\n\n~~~sh\n> npm install\n> npm run build\n~~~\n\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Lars Jung (https://larsjung.de)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
