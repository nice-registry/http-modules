The plain file\nnever touches the disk (unless you use nginx ([ticket][]) or some other proxy which\nbuffers uploads to disk).\n\n[ticket]: http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/251\n\nAfter the upload a download URL is generated and the encryption key is put in\nthe fragment identifier. It's put there in order to avoid it appearing in the server\nrequest logs when the URL is opened in the browser as fragments are never sent\nto the server. User is redirected to the URL and the encryption key is\ndiscarded.\n\nUser is presented with a download form generated by client-side Javascript.\nWhen the form is posted the encryption key is sent to the server in the request\nbody and the file download begins. After the download finishes the file is\ndeleted from the server.\n\n\n","created":"2015-03-31T17:21:10.775Z","modified":"2015-11-03T11:32:01.781Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"epeli","email":"esa-matti@suuronen.org"},"owners":[{"name":"epeli","email":"esa-matti@suuronen.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"tmpshare","_npmUser":{"name":"epeli","email":"esa-matti@suuronen.org"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_rev":"1-2bcb2ca798adfbf458ba9b1dcff52c5e","_shasum":"f16f745834ffb3ae12de92bb91270b394067ba5c","author":{"name":"Esa-Matti Suuronen","email":"esa-matti@suuronen.org"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"f16f745834ffb3ae12de92bb91270b394067ba5c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/tmpshare/-/tmpshare-1.2.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"epeli","email":"esa-matti@suuronen.org"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-11-03T11:32:01.781Z","created":"2015-03-31T17:21:10.775Z","1.0.0":"2015-03-31T17:21:10.775Z","1.0.1":"2015-03-31T17:24:27.558Z","1.0.2":"2015-03-31T19:44:35.491Z","1.1.0":"2015-04-23T12:08:35.449Z","1.2.0":"2015-10-14T11:53:05.463Z","1.2.1":"2015-11-03T11:32:01.781Z"}}}
