If piped data from a\n`flowHttp` request, it will detect if the response has the content-type\n`application/json` in which case it will parse it automatically and pipe\nthe parsed object down the stream.\n\nIf you know that the response is **always** JSON, you should use the\n[JSONStream](https://github.com/dominictarr/JSONStream) module instead.\nThis module will only try to parse the response as JSON if the\ncontent-type allows it.\n\n```javascript\nvar flowHttp = require('flowhttp');\nvar JsonParser = require('flowhttp-json');\n\nflowHttp('http://example.com/foo.json')\n  .pipe(new JsonParser())\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2013-12-27T16:06:14.318Z"},{"number":"0.1.1","date":"2013-12-27T16:18:04.537Z"}],"created":"2013-12-27T16:06:12.816Z","modified":"2013-12-27T16:18:04.537Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"watson","email":"w@tson.dk"},"owners":[{"name":"watson","email":"w@tson.dk"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"flowhttp-json","_npmUser":{"name":"watson","email":"w@tson.dk"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.14","_rev":"1-922e252110f050ae0f09b342d39157c9","author":{"name":"Thomas Watson Steen","email":"w@tson.dk"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/watson/flowhttp-json/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"4c9d555cf490b53d4832b81de17ef41d2ac4ae5e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/flowhttp-json/-/flowhttp-json-0.1.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"watson","email":"w@tson.dk"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-12-27T16:18:04.537Z","created":"2013-12-27T16:06:12.816Z","0.1.0":"2013-12-27T16:06:14.318Z","0.1.1":"2013-12-27T16:18:04.537Z"}}}
