Bedrock router solves these issues.\n\n## API\n\n```\nconst WebApp = require('bedrock-routes').WebApp\n```\n\n### new WebApp()\n\nConstructs a new router. A router is an extension of Node's `http.Server`.\n\nIn addition to the usual [Node HTTP events](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html), these events are emitted:\n\n - **processingError**: when the route produced an error message\n - **notFound**: when no rule was found for the specified request\n\n### app.listen(port?)\n\nListens on the specified port, or a random available port if no port is specified. Returns an empty promise.\n\n### app.addRoute(route, callback)\n\nAdds a route to the application. Callback has the form `(req, res) => any`, where `any` can be a promise which possibly gets rejected.\n\n## Trivia\n\nManabi is named after a reqion in Ecuador which produces coffee beans.\n\n","created":"2016-07-13T18:11:46.507Z","modified":"2016-07-13T18:11:46.507Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"samvv","email":"sam@vervaeck.be"},"owners":[{"name":"samvv","email":"sam@vervaeck.be"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"bedrock-routes","_nodeVersion":"5.12.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/bedrock-routes-1.0.0.tgz_1468433503885_0.3078752097208053"},"_npmUser":{"name":"samvv","email":"sam@vervaeck.be"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"1-31b3ba042540ec61d8a4f35d46ec275a","_shasum":"9cf0b2a8dab02715690c6c4f02814d707edb0e26","author":{"name":"Sam Vervaeck"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/samvv/manabi/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"9cf0b2a8dab02715690c6c4f02814d707edb0e26","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/bedrock-routes/-/bedrock-routes-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"samvv","email":"sam@vervaeck.be"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-07-13T18:11:46.507Z","created":"2016-07-13T18:11:46.507Z","1.0.0":"2016-07-13T18:11:46.507Z"}}}
