It can be used to install dependencies, start Sage and it services, monitor Sage, and shut it down.\n\nTo use the tool, run:\n\n    source sage.env\n\n##Installation\nTo install Sage, along with its dependencies, run:\n\n    sage install\n\nTo check the installation, and execute project tests, run:\n\n    sage check\n\nTo install example data used by the demo, run:\n\n    sage examples\n\n##Configuration\nSage services are configured in a simple configuration file in `conf/services.json` listing an HTTP port, the name of the service, the Node.js control file, and a configuration file. A sample services configuration is available at `conf/services-sample.json`. To get started:\n\n    cp conf/services-sample.json conf/services.json\n\n##Running Sage\nTo start Sage, run:\n\n    sage start\n\nAll the services configured in `conf/services.json` are started. Their process IDs and network ports are listed.\n\nTo stop Sage, run:\n\n    sage stop\n\nTo restart Sage, run:\n\n    sage restart\n\nTo determine whether Sage and its services are running, run:\n\n    sage status\n\nEach of the above management commands can be run on individual services by supplying the service name as an argument:\n\n    sage {start,stop,restart,status} <service-name>\n\n##More Help\n\n[API documentation for the library](http://silvn.github.io/sage/api)\n\nThe `sage` startup script has a general and command-specific help facility. To find out more about it, run:\n\n    sage help [<command>]\n\n##Coding Style and Conventions\nTODO\n\n##Changelog\n\n####v0.1.4\n\n* Bug fixes\n\n####v0.1.3\n\n* Service events.\n* Lists can show specific resource properties.\n\n####v0.1.2\n\n* Handling URL templates for resource fetching.\n* Bugs zapped.\n\n####v0.1.1\n\n* XML responses\n* Collection schema use associated resource schema\n\n####v0.1.0\n\n* Services\n    * Logging with Bunyan\n* Service Registry\n    * Registry proxies for remote services.\n    * `Service#registry` promises to be resolved when registry pings.\n* Resources and Collections\n    * Resources and collections can be associated with services.\n    * Services provide default routes and responses.\n    * Services can fetch collections and resources from remote endpoints.\n    * Resources can override parsing data from remote endpoints.\n    * Collections act as native Arrays.\n* Sage class exposes Service, Resource, and Registry.\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.4","date":"2013-11-19T14:04:02.840Z"},{"number":"0.1.5","date":"2013-11-19T14:08:26.011Z"}],"created":"2013-11-19T14:04:01.744Z","modified":"2013-11-19T14:08:26.011Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"gingi","email":"shiranpasternak@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"gingi","email":"shiranpasternak@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-sage","_npmUser":{"name":"gingi","email":"shiranpasternak@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.14","_rev":"1-ece52be98edc111af0d850be6b036519","author":{"name":"Shiran Pasternak","email":"shiranpasternak@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/silvn/sage/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.5"},"dist":{"shasum":"b77bc57516d9a96221bace19af2bb63886a61312","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-sage/-/node-sage-0.1.5.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"gingi","email":"shiranpasternak@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-11-19T14:08:26.011Z","created":"2013-11-19T14:04:01.744Z","0.1.4":"2013-11-19T14:04:02.840Z","0.1.5":"2013-11-19T14:08:26.011Z"}}}
