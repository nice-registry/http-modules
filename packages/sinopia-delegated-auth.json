Developers are accustomed to be able to use\nthe same password everywhere in the organisation to gain access to resources\nthat they need for their work. This should also apply to our private `npm`\nrepositories.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nBasically, authentication is delegated to *another* website where Kerberos\nauthentication is already set up. The Sinopia authentication plugin is given\nthe URL of this website. Whenever the user tries to authenticate with Sinopia\nusing a username-password combination, Sinopia makes an HTTP request in the\nbackground to this URL with the credentials that the user supplied. When the\nwebsite returns an HTTP 200 response, the password is considered correct and\nthe user is authenticated in Sinopia. In all other cases, authentication fails.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n$ npm install sinopia-delegated-auth\n```\n\n## Config\n\nAdd to your `config.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nauth:\n  delegated-auth:\n    url: \"https://some.other.site.com/auth\"\n```\n\n## Security considerations\n\nSinopia sends an HTTP Basic authentication request to the delegate website. The\nusual security considerations for HTTP Basic authentication apply here: don't\ndo it over an unencrypted channel unless you are *absolutely* sure that\nunauthorised parties cannot intercept the communication and inspect the\npassword in the Authorization header. Use `https` if you can. \n","created":"2017-01-20T21:28:31.532Z","modified":"2017-06-22T10:18:11.661Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"milinnovations","email":"tamas@milinnovations.com"},"owners":[{"email":"ntamas@gmail.com","name":"ntamas42"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"sinopia-delegated-auth","_nodeVersion":"7.3.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/sinopia-delegated-auth-0.0.1.tgz_1484947709721_0.9041744535788894"},"_npmUser":{"name":"milinnovations","email":"tamas@milinnovations.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"4-0e9d6917ec337eb0dfbd09659b49a8c0","_shasum":"5b885b5407125039aa8f78ed142765d1603fec0e","author":{"name":"MIL Innovation AS"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/milinnovations/sinopia-delegated-auth/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"5b885b5407125039aa8f78ed142765d1603fec0e","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/sinopia-delegated-auth/-/sinopia-delegated-auth-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"ntamas@gmail.com","name":"ntamas42"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-22T10:18:11.661Z","created":"2017-01-20T21:28:31.532Z","0.0.1":"2017-01-20T21:28:31.532Z"}}}
