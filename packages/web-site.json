Like stopping. Or parsing form data. Or handling AJAX requests. These things are the most basic, fundamental activities of a web server, it's OK to load them by default.\n\n## Features\n\n* Parses submitted forms by default\n* Parses JSON forms by default\n* Parses cookies by default\n* site.stop()\n* site.isStarted()\n* site.getPort()\n\n## BYOHS (Bring Your Own HTTP Server)\n\nIf you want to tell the web site to use a different http server, you can ask it to relinquish control of starting and stopping:\n\n```javascript\nvar site = new WebSite()\nsite.addRoute(...)\n\nsite.relinquishControl(function() {\n  var httpServer = ...\n\n  // we can start this here, or wait, or whatever\n\n  // Then we return the httpServer so the routes can go into that instead:\n  return httpServer\n}\n```\n\nSee [get-socket](https://github.com/erikpukinskis/get-socket/blob/master/get-socket.js#L77) for an example.\n\n## sendFile\n\nA method for static files is included just so you don't have to include the path module:\n\n```javascript\nsite.addRoute(\n  \"/some-script.js\",\n  site.sendFile(\"./path/to/your/jazz.js\")\n)\n```\n","created":"2016-11-20T03:06:21.975Z","modified":"2017-03-27T01:24:29.552Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"erikpukinskis","email":"erik@snowedin.net"},"owners":[{"name":"erikpukinskis","email":"erik@snowedin.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"web-site","_nodeVersion":"0.12.7","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/web-site-0.44.0.tgz_1490577869273_0.3741676362697035"},"_npmUser":{"name":"erikpukinskis","email":"erik@snowedin.net"},"_npmVersion":"2.11.3","_rev":"18-a22f831a13651330b6bd35c3e37809ad","_shasum":"8798759ee9d7fe01494029ce32de36535fe1b0d4","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/erikpukinskis/web-site/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.44.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"8798759ee9d7fe01494029ce32de36535fe1b0d4","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/web-site/-/web-site-0.44.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"erikpukinskis","email":"erik@snowedin.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-27T01:24:29.552Z","created":"2016-11-20T03:06:21.975Z","0.27.0":"2016-11-20T03:06:21.975Z","0.28.0":"2016-11-23T23:39:17.924Z","0.29.0":"2016-11-27T00:42:35.112Z","0.30.0":"2016-12-01T18:33:21.503Z","0.31.0":"2016-12-02T06:17:39.160Z","0.32.0":"2016-12-06T20:14:16.301Z","0.33.0":"2016-12-10T00:28:17.381Z","0.34.0":"2016-12-12T23:36:30.913Z","0.35.0":"2016-12-14T00:58:29.325Z","0.36.0":"2016-12-14T18:48:07.275Z","0.37.0":"2016-12-29T01:30:28.875Z","0.38.0":"2016-12-29T01:37:59.123Z","0.39.0":"2017-01-10T07:08:07.796Z","0.40.0":"2017-01-12T00:55:03.115Z","0.41.0":"2017-01-14T06:22:02.132Z","0.42.0":"2017-01-17T01:16:33.959Z","0.43.0":"2017-02-09T01:09:40.167Z","0.44.0":"2017-03-27T01:24:29.552Z"}}}
