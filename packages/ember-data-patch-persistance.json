If that occurs, you can set `alwaysPatch` to\n`true` in the model definition:\n\n```js\n// models/car.js\nimport DS from 'ember-data';\n\nexport default DS.Model.extend({\n  colour: DS.attr('string'),\n  wheels: DS.attr('number'),\n  owner: DS.belongsTo('person', { async: true, alwaysPatch: true })\n});\n```\n\nPatch Persistance plays nice with relationships as long as you follow Ember Data\nconventions.\n\n## Notes\n\n- This addon reopens the `DS.Model` and `DS.RESTAdapter` classes; thus,\n  all extended objects from these classes will have the `.patch()` method\n  available. I'm considering refactoring the addon as a mixin on a future\n  version, provided there is interest enough on such feature.\n\n- The addon has been tested up to Ember Data 1.0.0-beta17, without issues.\n\n## Have an issue?\n\nFeel free to post an issue in this repository! :)\n\n## Have any ideas?\n\nBy all means, feel free to make a PR!\n","created":"2015-06-09T19:56:54.612Z","modified":"2015-06-09T20:00:32.708Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"joel-alejandro","email":"joel.a.villarreal@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"joel-alejandro","email":"joel.a.villarreal@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ember-data-patch-persistance","_nodeVersion":"0.12.4","_npmUser":{"name":"joel-alejandro","email":"joel.a.villarreal@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.10.1","_rev":"1-022894b51f438c6e4330a6f9933a4b5c","_shasum":"36cba0fc61331eb7dae92db6cb0e2855eaffa23a","author":"","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/joelalejandro/ember-data-patch-persistance/issues"},"directories":{"doc":"doc","test":"tests"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"36cba0fc61331eb7dae92db6cb0e2855eaffa23a","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ember-data-patch-persistance/-/ember-data-patch-persistance-0.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"joel-alejandro","email":"joel.a.villarreal@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-06-09T20:00:32.708Z","created":"2015-06-09T19:56:54.612Z","0.0.1":"2015-06-09T19:56:54.612Z","0.0.2":"2015-06-09T20:00:32.708Z"}}}
