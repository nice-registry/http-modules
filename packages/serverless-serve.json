This plugin allows you to simulate API Gateway locally, so all function calls can be done on localhost.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nIn your Serverless project:\n\n```\nnpm install serverless-serve\n```\n\nThen in `s-project.json` add following entry to `plugins` array:\n\n```\n\"serverless-serve\"\n```\n\nE.g. like this:\n```\n  plugins: [\"serverless-serve\"]\n```\n\nAnd in main project root do:\n\n```\nsls serve start\n```\n\nOptions\n=======\n\n`--prefix` `-p`: Add prefix to the URLs, so your clients will not use `http://localhost:1465/` but `http://localhost:1465/prefix/` instead. Default: empty\n\n`--port` `-P`: Port to listen on. Default: `1465`\n\n`--stage` `-s` & `--region` `-r`: If both are given (or there is only 1 region and stage is given), then endpoint response definition will get the template/variable resolved.\n\n`--init` `-i`: Initialization file, for custom initializations. Default: empty. NOTE: please specify relative paths from project root folder, e.g. `sls serve start -i ./lib/my_init.js`. Init file should export single function taking following parameters:\n- `Serverless` object\n- `app` object from Express (e.g. to register new routes)\n- `handlers` object being map of all function names to info about their respective handlers. Since all handlers are `require`'d lazily, this plugin exports only path information about handler, in following format:\n```\n{\n  path: \"path/to/be/required\",\n  handler: \"exported-function-name\"\n}\n```\n\nso this should work: `require( handlers[ myFunName ].path )[ handlers[ myFunName ].handler ]( event, context )`\n\nExample:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = function(S, app, handlers){\n}\n```\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nJust send your requests to `http://localhost:1465/` as it would be API Gateway.\n\nUsing of this plugin with some tool like Nodemon is advised, so Serverless with restart and reload your local code after every change.\n\nUsage with Babel\n================\n\nOptionaly, your handlers can be required with `babel-register`.\nTo do so, in your `s-project.json` file, set options to be passed to babel-register like this:\n```\n{\n  /* ... */\n  \"custom\": {\n    \"serverless-serve\": {\n      \"babelOptions\": {\n        /* Your own options, example: */\n        presets: [\"es2015\", \"stage-2\"]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"plugins\": [\"serverless-serve\", /* ... */]\n}\n```\nTo view the full list of babel-register options, click [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/require/)\n\nSimulation quality\n==================\n\nThis plugin simulates API Gateway for many practical purposes, good enough for development - but is not a perfect simulator. Specifically, no timeout or memory limits are enforced. Mapping templates and/or error codes are not simulated, either. So are security checks. You will probably find other differences.\n\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-12-11T16:21:11.384Z","modified":"2016-04-19T11:36:44.631Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"nopik","email":"kamil@nopik.net"},"owners":[{"name":"nopik","email":"kamil@nopik.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"serverless-serve","_nodeVersion":"5.9.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/serverless-serve-1.7.2.tgz_1461065802018_0.5034105677623302"},"_npmUser":{"name":"nopik","email":"kamil@nopik.net"},"_npmVersion":"3.7.3","_rev":"1-2daa1aa30242179906e31749dfe2a45f","_shasum":"aed5eecfeddc549ea5c547913880e73b4975c856","author":{"name":"Kamil Burzynski"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Nopik/serverless-serve/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.7.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"aed5eecfeddc549ea5c547913880e73b4975c856","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/serverless-serve/-/serverless-serve-1.7.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"nopik","email":"kamil@nopik.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-04-19T11:36:44.631Z","created":"2015-12-11T16:21:11.384Z","1.0.0":"2015-12-11T16:21:11.384Z","1.1.0":"2015-12-11T16:38:19.201Z","1.2.0":"2015-12-11T16:52:55.395Z","1.2.1":"2015-12-11T18:08:48.900Z","1.2.2":"2015-12-15T13:16:51.391Z","1.2.3":"2015-12-16T13:56:07.105Z","1.3.0":"2016-01-04T18:10:17.939Z","1.4.0":"2016-02-05T17:01:48.587Z","1.4.1":"2016-02-15T09:04:04.112Z","1.5.0":"2016-02-15T09:52:43.703Z","1.5.1":"2016-02-19T08:35:45.369Z","1.5.2":"2016-02-19T09:12:54.580Z","1.7.0":"2016-04-18T10:50:04.396Z","1.7.2":"2016-04-19T11:36:44.631Z"},"users":{"s3than":true}}}
