Ridiculously early push this.\r\n\r\n## Intro\r\n\r\nAdds a 'fetch' method for loading a Hypermedia resource from a server, and a 'execute' method for sending Command data to a server. \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall with [npm(1)](http://npmjs.org):\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm install --save hyperbone-model-with-io\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nIf you don't already have grunt..\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm install -g grunt-cli\r\n```\r\nAfter cloning the repo..\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm install\r\n```\r\nTo run the tests\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm test\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nInstead of ...\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar Model = require('hyperbone-model').Model;\r\n```\r\n\r\ndo...\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar Model = require('hyperbone-model-with-io').Model;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\n### .fetch()\r\n\r\nAssuming your model has a self href, it will load the hypermedia and fire a `sync` event, as per normal Backbone. Parameters in the callback\r\nare the model and the request response.\r\n\r\n### .execute( \"command name\" )\r\n\r\nIf you're using the '_commands' functionality, calling `.execute` will seralise the command's properties and PUT/POST/DELETE etc to the specified HREF. \r\n\r\nHTTP error codes 201, 200 and 202 are considered successful. ANything else counts as an error. \r\nOn success, a .fetch() automatically happens. If it's an error this doesn't happen. \r\n\r\nIt will also trigger `executed` or `execution-failed` which is passed the command that failed. This should bubble up to the parent model.\r\n\r\n### .execute( \"command name\", callback )\r\n\r\nIf you pass a callback, instead of an automatic .fetch() happening your callback is called so you can manually decide whether or not to resync.\r\n\r\nThe parameters passed to the callback are `err` and `response`. 201, 200 and 202 are considered successful. ANything else counts as an error.\r\n\r\nIt will also trigger `executed` or `execution-failed`, which is passed the command that failed.\r\n\r\nAnd this gives you Hyperbone Models with the HTTP extensions. This module is badly named really. This should bubble up to the parent model.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n  MIT\r\n","created":"2014-06-21T14:45:18.551Z","modified":"2014-11-12T12:36:26.946Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"charlottegore","email":"conspiracygore@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"charlottegore","email":"conspiracygore@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"hyperbone-model-with-io","_npmUser":{"name":"charlottegore","email":"conspiracygore@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_rev":"1-c29cb3b3670776511f57a84154c5d3ae","_shasum":"d83fb97c50e0f287d73c5a750af022adf0baa7a0","author":{"name":"template"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/green-mesa/hyperbone-model-with-io/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.21"},"dist":{"shasum":"d83fb97c50e0f287d73c5a750af022adf0baa7a0","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hyperbone-model-with-io/-/hyperbone-model-with-io-0.1.21.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"charlottegore","email":"conspiracygore@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"Readme.md","time":{"modified":"2014-11-12T12:36:26.946Z","created":"2014-06-21T14:45:18.551Z","0.1.13":"2014-06-21T14:45:21.272Z","0.1.17":"2014-09-23T14:47:30.679Z","0.1.19":"2014-11-06T11:24:31.776Z","0.1.21":"2014-11-12T12:36:26.946Z"}}}
