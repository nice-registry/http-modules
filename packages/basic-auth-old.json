See [http://expressjs.com/api.html#middleware](http://expressjs.com/api.html#middleware)\n\n### Why?\n\nI needed just very basic auth for NodeJS and I couldn't find a module that worked.\n\nTo install:\n\n```\nnpm install basic-auth-old\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar auth = require('basic-auth')({\n  name: 'Auth Box Name',\n  accounts: [\n    'username:password',\n    'user2:pass2'\n  ]\n})\n```\n\nThis is by no means a secure system. This is good if you have a page that just needs to prevent some unauthorized access (such as an intranet).","created":"2013-11-29T20:25:10.462Z","modified":"2017-05-22T11:22:54.694Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"dawnerd","email":"troy@somanyscientists.com"},"owners":[{"email":"troy@somany.us","name":"dawnerd"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"basic-auth-old","_npmUser":{"name":"dawnerd","email":"troy@somanyscientists.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.5","_rev":"2-10c3ec6860fc92132645c06bff1031fc","author":{"name":"Troy Whiteley","email":"troy@somanyscientists.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dawnerd/node-basic-auth/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"46a564461d07a5348eee8a0cca5f3faa15532062","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/basic-auth-old/-/basic-auth-old-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"troy@somany.us","name":"dawnerd"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-22T11:22:54.694Z","created":"2013-11-29T20:25:10.462Z","0.0.1":"2013-11-29T20:25:11.237Z"}}}
