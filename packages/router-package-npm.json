Here are some examples:\n\n####GET Route\n```\n  productsRouter.get('/products', function(req, res) {\n    console.log('get route set for products');\n    res.write('GET route hit');\n    res.end();\n});\n```\n\n####POST Route\n```\n  productsRouter.post('/products', function(req,res){\n    console.log('post route set for /products');\n    res.write('POST route hit');\n    res.end();\n});\n```\n\nKeep in mind that you can also create PUT And DELETE routes.\n\nOnce you're done, You'll want to initialize your server. Here is an example of that:\n\n``http.createServer(productsRouter.route()).listen(3000);``\n\n##Vision\n\nOur vision is to provide small, efficient, and robust tooling for building HTTP servers. This makes it an ideal solution for building single-page applications, web sites or hybrids.\n\nrouter-package-npm does not require that you use a specific templating engine.\n\n##Testing\n\nMocha/Chai testing is integrated into this app! Feel free to check the Mocha/Chai documentation for more detail on this.\n\n##License\n\nMIT. Because MIT is awesome and we are too.\n","created":"2016-03-14T17:42:08.608Z","modified":"2016-03-14T17:42:08.608Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"guerrahugoa","email":"guerrahugoa@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"guerrahugoa","email":"guerrahugoa@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"router-package-npm","_nodeVersion":"4.3.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/router-package-npm-1.0.0.tgz_1457977327985_0.40396656189113855"},"_npmUser":{"name":"guerrahugoa","email":"guerrahugoa@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.12","_rev":"1-d713b9f7b2a1cee505a5582ca42bdc48","_shasum":"736d2feb8f885443ffc3626384f19f33e7922aa5","author":{"name":"Hugo A Guerra","email":"guerrahugoa@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/alexwuwei/router-package-npm/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"736d2feb8f885443ffc3626384f19f33e7922aa5","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/router-package-npm/-/router-package-npm-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"guerrahugoa","email":"guerrahugoa@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-03-14T17:42:08.608Z","created":"2016-03-14T17:42:08.608Z","1.0.0":"2016-03-14T17:42:08.608Z"}}}
