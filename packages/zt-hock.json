The projected looked like it was dead (no comments, merged PRs for more than half a year). As a result, we decided to forked\nthe project, re-write it and add our missing features.\n\n## Difference with hock\n\nAt a glance:\n\n- Modern code base, written in ES6\n- delay() API\n- Object comparison for bodies tries to compare first using deep-equals, then falls back to stringify\n- Option to turn off throwing errors for unprocessed requests in the assertion queue\n- ... we await your feature requests!\n\n## WIP: Readme\n","created":"2017-06-15T10:56:33.421Z","modified":"2017-06-21T05:15:56.445Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"zeroturnaround","email":"npm@zeroturnaround.com"},"owners":[{"name":"zeroturnaround","email":"npm@zeroturnaround.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"zt-hock","_nodeVersion":"6.11.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/zt-hock-0.1.0.tgz_1498022155511_0.3980989707633853"},"_npmUser":{"name":"zeroturnaround","email":"npm@zeroturnaround.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"3-240afec8e1abb97d7427989dcdac14e2","_shasum":"6a386e33d897ecd3b3c1d3e008974b2653245519","author":{"name":"Joachim Seminck","email":"joachim@seminck.be"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-hock/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Joachim Seminck","email":"joachim@seminck.be"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"6a386e33d897ecd3b3c1d3e008974b2653245519","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/zt-hock/-/zt-hock-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"zeroturnaround","email":"npm@zeroturnaround.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-21T05:15:56.445Z","created":"2017-06-15T10:56:33.421Z","0.0.0":"2017-06-15T10:56:33.421Z","0.0.2":"2017-06-21T04:35:50.738Z","0.1.0":"2017-06-21T05:15:56.445Z"}}}
