Out of the box it supports http and scp. HTTP downloads use [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got), and SCP works over [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```\n$ npm install mc-download --save\n```\n\nYou can then require MC-Download in your project and you will have access to the Download object and various helpers.\n\n```\nvar Download = require('mc-download');\n\n// download via http with object\nvar dl = new Download('https://github.com/lkwdwrd/mc-download/archive/master.zip', '.');\ndl.run();\n// download via http with helper\nDownload.download('https://github.com/lkwdwrd/mc-download/archive/master.zip', '.', {}, callback);\n\n// download via scp with object\nvar dl = new Download( 'lkwdwrd@example.com:/var/www/somefile.txt', '.', {type: 'scp'});\ndl.run();\n// download via scp with helper\nDownload.download('lkwdwrd@example.com:/var/www/somefile.txt', '.', {type: 'scp'}, callback );\n```\n\n## The Download Object\n\n```\nvar dl = new Download( location, destination, [options] );\n```\n\nThis will set up a new download object for you, creating a file object with a read stream for each of the locations specified. You can then start the download with `Download.run()` which will stream all objects to the OS temp folder and then move them to the destination folder running them through plugins.\n\n### location\n\nType: `String|Array`\n\nThe location or locations of the file. For http request this will be a URL, for SCP requests this will be at least a file path, but can contain server, username, and password as well. If more than one file is specified, items should be file paths. The first time can be used to designate the extra meta if desired.\n\n### destination\n\nType: `String`\n\nThe folder where the files should be downloaded to. The files can be renamed after download using the rename option. They will be run through [gulp-rename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rename)\n\n### options\n\nType: `object`\n\nA object controlling how the download takes place\n\n#### options.type\n\nType: `string`\nDefault: `'http'`\n\nEither 'http', 'scp', or an object containing a 'getReadStreams' method which returns a promise resolving to an array of readable streams. By using 'http' or 'scp', MC-Download will use the built in scp or https channels.\n\n#### options.username\n\nType: `string`\n\nIf not specified in the scp location, you can supply a username in the options object. This will work for both basic http auth and for scp. The username specified in the location string will take precedence over the username specified in the options object.\n\n#### options.password\n\nType: `string`\n\nIf not specified in the scp location, you can supply a password in the options object. This will work for both basic http auth (and will be required) or for scp (and is optional). Any password specified in the location string will take precedence over the password specified in the options object.\n\n#### options.adapter\n\nType: `object`\n\nBy supplying an adapter, implementers can control how data flows to and from the user. An adapter object should have an `adapter.log` object which has methods defined for at least `adapter.log.info()` and `adapter.log.debug()`. The object should also have an `adapter.prompt` method for asking the user for information. Finally, if desired the adapter object can implement `adapter.progress()` as a method which will recieve a set of file objects, each of which will contain `file.stats`, an object which will emit `progress` events and can be used to report progress of the transfer.\n\nThe get an idea of how each of these can be implemented, take a look at the default [adapter object](lib/util/adapter.js). It uses [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for logging, [inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) for prompting, and a custom implementation of [multi-progress](https://github.com/pitaj/multi-progress) to display progress bars for the downloads.\n\n#### options.adapterOpts\n\nType: `object`\n\nA set of options passed to the built in adapter. Currently this only supports a `adapterOpts.progress` property. This can either be a function allowing for a custom progress implementation, or can be `'text'` to switch the default progress bars to a simple 'Downloading file...' message. This is useful if the progress bars don't make much sense for your use case.\n\n#### options.rewrite\n\nType: `string|object|function`\n\nRewrites a file name using either a hard coded string, a file path object, or a function. See the [gulp-rename](https://github.com/hparra/gulp-rename) for more information.\n\n#### options.extract\n\nType: `boolean`\n\nWhether to attempt extracting the file after the download is complete. This will extract .zip, .tar, .tar.gz, and .tar.bz files using the [decompress](https://github.com/kevva/decompress/) library.\n\n#### options.transforms\n\nType: `Array`\n\nAn array of transform streams to run each downloaded file through. Downloads are run through [VinylFS](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl-fs), which opens up just about any gulp plugin as a transform. Note that transforms can also be added with `dl.addTransform(stream)` on a constructed Download object, but before calling `.run()`.\n\n#### Additional Options\n\nFor http, the options object is passed to the (got.stream)[https://github.com/sindresorhus/got] methd. Any options supported by Got are also supported by MC-Download.\n\nSimilarly, MC-Download uses the client API of [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2), and the options object is passed to the `.connect()` method allowing more control over how the SSH connection is made.\n\n## SCP Download Tips\n\nSCP is a bit trickier than HTTP downloads. To try and ease the complexit, MC-Download makes an attempt to be very flexible with SCP downloads. It will automatically look for an id_rsa key in `$HOME/.ssh/` and pass that along to the ssh client. This works on Windows as well using your user home directory. If the key requires a passphrase, MC-Download will detect this and prompt the user for it. Since this is a pure node implementation of SSH, it does not currently pull SSH passphrases out of keychain or similar tools. The Passphrase for an ssh key can also be passed in the options object `passkey: secretcode`.\n\nIf your ssh keys are stored in a different folder, MC-Download uses (rc)[https://github.com/dominictarr/rc] to allow you to specify a different location. Simply create a file in your home folder called `.mcdownloadrc`. This file should contain a JSON object that looks like the following:\n\n```\n{\n\t\"sshDir\": \"path/to/directory/with/ssh/keys\",\n\t\"hosts\": {\n\t\t\"RegexString\": \"key_name\"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nYou can map different keys to different SSH hosts by using a regular expression -> key name mapping. MC-Download will cycle through each regex and see if it matches the requested host and if a match is found, will use the SSH key with that name. It will go from first defined to last defined, and stop at the first match.\n\nWhen requesting a download with SCP, the location string can contain username, password, host, and path:\n\n```\nDownload.download('username:password@host.com:/path/to/file.ext', '.', {type: 'scp'});\n```\n\nAlternately you can omit the password if using an ssh key, or the user will be prompted for it:\n\n```\nDownload.download('username@host.com:/path/to/file.ext', '.', {type:'scp'});\n```\n\nOr you can omit the username entirely. It can then be passed as part of the options object, or it the user will be prompted to enter it prior to downloading.\n\n```\nDownload.download( 'host.com:/path/to/file.ext', '.', {type:'scp'});\n```\n\nOr can you pull everything out of the location string except for the path and place it in the options object. This is also the most straight forward way to download multiple files from the connections.\n\n```\nDownload.download( '/path/to/file.txt', '.', {\n\ttype:'scp',\n\thost:'host.com',\n\tusername:'username',\n\tpassword:'password'\n} );\n```\n\nTo download multple file, simply pass an array of file paths on the host. You can specify the username, password, and host in the first string if desired.\n\n```\nvar locations = [\n\t'username:password@host.com:/path/to/file.txt',\n\t'/path/to/another/file.txt',\n\t'/path/to/third/file/etc.tar.gz'\n];\nvar options = {\n\ttype: 'scp',\n\textract: true\n};\nDownload.download( locations, '.', options );\n```\n## Multi-Download\n\nMC-Download allows you to set up and monitor multiple downloads at once over whatever channels are available. This is made possible through a MultiDownload object. This object takes an array of objects with location, dest, and opts keys (accepting the same values in these keys as [the Download object](#the-download-object) takes for its constructor).\n\n```\nvar dl = new Download.MultiDownload([\n\t{\n\t\tlocation: 'https://github.com/lkwdwrd/mc-download/archive/master.zip',\n\t\tdest: '.'\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tlocation: 'lkwdwrd@example.com:/var/www/somefiles.tar.gz',\n\t\tdest: 'random/path',\n\t\topts: {\n\t\t\ttype: 'scp',\n\t\t\textract: true\n\t\t}\n\t}\n], opts );\ndl.run();\n```\n\nThere is also a `.multi` helper which will automatically create a MultiDownload object and call `run()` automatically, similart to the `.download()` helper.\n\n```\nDownload.multi([\n\t{\n\t\tlocation: 'https://github.com/lkwdwrd/mc-download/archive/master.zip',\n\t\tdest: '.'\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tlocation: 'lkwdwrd@example.com:/var/www/somefiles.tar.gz',\n\t\tdest: 'random/path',\n\t\topts: {\n\t\t\ttype: 'scp',\n\t\t\textract: true\n\t\t}\n\t}\n], opts );\n```\n\n## The MultiDownload Object\n\n```\nvar dl = new Download.MultiDownload( downloads, [options] );\n```\n\nThe MultiDownload is, of course, a wrapper around creating several Download instances and normalizing progress reporting. Once created, call `dl.run()` to run all of the downloads simultaneously. Before calling `dl.run()` you can allso call `dl.add( download )` to add additional download object before runnng them all.\n\n### downloads\n\nType: `Array`\n\nThis will be an array of download objects with location, dest, and optionally opts keys. These correspond with the constructor of the Download object and you can find more info on each of the keys values in the [Download object](#the-download-object) documentation. One exception is the options key. In MultiDownlod, the adapter's progress method is normalized so that it can monitor the progress of all downloads rather than just one Download object.\n\n### options\n\nThis object is far more limited than the main Download object options. It will either contain an [adapter object](#optionsadapter) or and [adapter options object](#optionsadapteropts)","created":"2016-03-20T14:40:51.531Z","modified":"2016-04-06T03:27:40.574Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"lkwdwrd","email":"woodward.lucas@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"lkwdwrd","email":"woodward.lucas@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"mc-download","_nodeVersion":"5.7.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/mc-download-1.1.2.tgz_1459913258047_0.35372800403274596"},"_npmUser":{"name":"lkwdwrd","email":"woodward.lucas@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.6.0","_rev":"1-4bdee6a96b1434299aba48d3ccde7d51","_shasum":"0dd66ca5db3b3951751c8b0cd771f9bc500fd6fe","author":{"name":"Luke Woodward","email":"woodward.lucas@gmail.com","url":"http://lkwdwrd.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/lkwdwrd/mc-download/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"0dd66ca5db3b3951751c8b0cd771f9bc500fd6fe","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/mc-download/-/mc-download-1.1.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"lkwdwrd","email":"woodward.lucas@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.MD","time":{"modified":"2016-04-06T03:27:40.574Z","created":"2016-03-20T14:40:51.531Z","0.1.0":"2016-03-20T14:40:51.531Z","0.1.1":"2016-03-20T14:42:43.253Z","1.0.0":"2016-03-27T23:34:55.277Z","1.1.0":"2016-04-04T03:28:20.202Z","1.1.1":"2016-04-04T03:30:32.347Z","1.1.2":"2016-04-06T03:27:40.574Z"}}}
