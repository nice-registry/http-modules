If \nsecured field is set to false, it has the same features as http in\nin the default installation.  It uses a predefined OAuth endpoint \nto validate the token in authorization header in a request and to check \nif the user with the token has privilege to access this node.\n\nInstall\n-------\nInstall from [npm](http://npmjs.org)\n```\nnpm install node-red-contrib-securedhttp\n```\n\nUsage\n-----\nThis package contains two nodes similar to the default http in and\nhttp out nodes but securedhttp in node must be authenticated with a \ntoken in Authorization header or access_token query string for \nprivileged user to access it if the \"Secured\" field is set to true.\nWhen \"Secured\" field is set to true, user will need to have the\nprivilege specified in \"Privileges\" field.  If the \"Privileges\" is not\nset but \"Secured\" field is set to true, an access token will need to \nbe validated.  The OAuth user endpoint will need to specify in the \nsettting.js file with \"oauth2UserUrl\" key.  For example,\n\n  oauth2UserUrl: \"https://localhost:8080/oauth/user\",\n\n\nSecuredHttp In node usage:\n-----------------\n\nYou will need to fill in the following fields:\n\n-- Ignore the \"Start\" field.\n\n-- Secured field set to true to enable security.  False to disable.\n\n-- User will need to have privilege to access this endpoint even the token is valid.\n\n\nAuthors\n-------\n* Kehang Chen - [kehangchen@yahoo.com](mailto:kehangchen@yahoo.com)\n","created":"2017-04-10T21:16:32.891Z","modified":"2017-04-11T16:02:43.407Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"kehangchen","email":"kehangchen@yahoo.com"},"owners":[{"name":"kehangchen","email":"kehangchen@yahoo.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-red-contrib-securedhttp","_nodeVersion":"6.10.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/node-red-contrib-securedhttp-1.0.4.tgz_1491926562724_0.8647754841949791"},"_npmUser":{"name":"kehangchen","email":"kehangchen@yahoo.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"5-42dbd7c745c4ca0df2d711d43d909add","_shasum":"fc9889938ad9c6f70a9899d068410d7a9279cf83","author":{"name":"Kehang Chen"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kehangchen/node-red-contrib-securedhttp/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Kehang Chen"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"fc9889938ad9c6f70a9899d068410d7a9279cf83","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/node-red-contrib-securedhttp/-/node-red-contrib-securedhttp-1.0.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"kehangchen","email":"kehangchen@yahoo.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-11T16:02:43.407Z","created":"2017-04-10T21:16:32.891Z","1.0.0":"2017-04-10T21:16:32.891Z","1.0.1":"2017-04-11T14:54:44.539Z","1.0.2":"2017-04-11T15:08:23.934Z","1.0.3":"2017-04-11T15:36:15.910Z","1.0.4":"2017-04-11T16:02:43.407Z"}}}
