Each\nis controlled independently by a microcontroller with its own IP address, which\nresponds to HTTP requests. This module wraps the process of addressing and\nrouting to each bucket.\n\nThere are a small variety of demos under `examples/`.\n\n## Usage\n\nLet's draw a gradient:\n\n```js\nvar draw = require('internet-of-buckets')\n\nfor (var i=0; i < 10; i++) {\n  for (var j=0; j < 5; j++) {\n    var red = 255 * i / 10\n    var green = 0\n    var blue = 255 - 255 * j / 5\n    draw(i, j, [red, green, blue])\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will output\n\n<img src=\"gradient.jpg\"/>\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar draw = require('internet-of-buckets')\n```\n\n### draw(x, y, rgb, cb=function noop(){})\n\nSets a single bucket at `(x, y)` to the colour `rgb`.\n\nThe top left corner is `(0, 0)`, and the bottom right corner is `(9, 4)`.\n\n`rgb` is an array of size 3, with values between `0-255`. It represents the red,\ngreen, and blue components respectively.\n\nIf provided, `cb` is a function that will be called once the write is complete.\nThis can be be useful for e.g. synchronizing several buckets' updates.\n\n\n## Install\n\nWith [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed, run\n\n```\n$ npm install internet-of-buckets\n```\n\n## License\n\nISC\n\n","created":"2016-08-25T22:22:22.009Z","modified":"2016-08-25T22:22:22.009Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"noffle","email":"stephen.whitmore@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"noffle","email":"stephen.whitmore@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"internet-of-buckets","_nodeVersion":"6.2.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/internet-of-buckets-1.0.2.tgz_1472163741774_0.41546072671189904"},"_npmUser":{"name":"noffle","email":"stephen.whitmore@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.9","_rev":"1-cea6b0fefa1b043df236b49ec97fee32","_shasum":"a1c3ff77cb8d813722967f9b095f419f24ec1ddf","author":{"name":"Stephen Whitmore","email":"stephen.whitmore@gmail.com"},"directories":{"example":"examples"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"a1c3ff77cb8d813722967f9b095f419f24ec1ddf","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/internet-of-buckets/-/internet-of-buckets-1.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"noffle","email":"stephen.whitmore@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-08-25T22:22:22.009Z","created":"2016-08-25T22:22:22.009Z","1.0.2":"2016-08-25T22:22:22.009Z"}}}
