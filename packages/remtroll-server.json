[Installation](#installation)\n2. [Initial Setup](#initial-setup)\n3. [Configuration](#configuration)\n4. [Security](#security)\n\n# Installation\nTo install from the command line, run:\n\n`npm install remtroll-server -g`\n\n# Initial setup\nFollow these steps to setup the server.\n\n1. `remtroll --config`\n2. `remtroll --setup`\n3. Start the server: `remtroll`\n4. In the RemTroll app, enter the 4 digit code and it will self configure.\n\n# Configuration\nYou can run `remtroll --config` to run through the configuration options and edit\nthe default configuration file.\n\nSee [the wiki](https://github.com/digitalcatnip/remtroll-server/wiki) for details\non what each configuration option means.\n\nIf you have a custom configuration file, you can run the server with the command\n`remtroll <path to config>`.\n\n# Security\nBy default, the server is configured to run without security.  We recommend changing this by\nfollowing instructions on [the wiki](https://github.com/digitalcatnip/remtroll-server/wiki#self-signed-certificate)\nto create a self-signed certificate before adding the server to your app. Once you've\ndone that you can update the configuration with the path to your new private key\nand public certificate.\n\nWe also recommend you wait until you have the security setup until you upload\nthe configuration to the app using `remtroll --setup`\n","created":"2015-09-29T14:40:38.128Z","modified":"2017-05-11T12:13:24.764Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"digitalcatnip","email":"james@catnip.io"},"owners":[{"name":"digitalcatnip","email":"james@catnip.io"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"remtroll-server","_nodeVersion":"6.9.5","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/remtroll-server-0.13.1.tgz_1494504804002_0.16753820376470685"},"_npmUser":{"name":"digitalcatnip","email":"james@catnip.io"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"9-9da71bd6fee107858218e08b6eef434a","_shasum":"a77dd4cbf6a492fdbfc26005f834a2e58957dc03","author":{"name":"James McCarthy"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/digitalcatnip/remtroll-server/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.13.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"a77dd4cbf6a492fdbfc26005f834a2e58957dc03","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/remtroll-server/-/remtroll-server-0.13.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"digitalcatnip","email":"james@catnip.io"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-11T12:13:24.764Z","created":"2015-09-29T14:40:38.128Z","0.0.1":"2015-09-29T14:40:38.128Z","0.1.0":"2015-09-29T15:22:10.908Z","0.2.0":"2015-09-29T15:37:12.587Z","0.3.0":"2015-09-29T15:55:10.711Z","0.4.0":"2015-09-29T16:11:06.136Z","0.5.0":"2015-09-29T16:47:58.685Z","0.6.0":"2015-09-29T19:49:36.979Z","0.7.0":"2015-09-29T20:20:53.022Z","0.8.0":"2015-09-30T16:15:53.336Z","0.9.0":"2017-02-12T19:55:57.235Z","0.9.1":"2017-02-19T12:07:40.475Z","0.10.0":"2017-03-12T16:02:47.798Z","0.11.1":"2017-03-12T19:59:38.167Z","0.11.2":"2017-03-12T20:10:36.162Z","0.11.3":"2017-03-14T21:47:50.146Z","0.12.0":"2017-03-19T15:32:22.686Z","0.13.1":"2017-05-11T12:13:24.764Z"}}}
