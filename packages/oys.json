Once this project has met *your* ( the communities' ) defined security requirements, I will be glad to brand and label `oys` as \"Production Ready\".\n\nUntil then please feel free to [open a Github Issue](https://github.com/Marak/oys/issues/new) with any security issues or questions or send an email to [support@marak.com](mailto:support@marak.com)\n\n## Features\n\n  - Protects your configurations and secrets by removing them your servers\n  - Removes all your secrets from ENV, CLI, and local config variables\n  - Secrets Server + Secrets Agent\n  - Secrets Web Administration Interface\n  - Optional HTTP push configurations to Server environments\n  - Optional Express based Middleware for recieving remote configuration push\n\n## Installation\n\n**Three Installation Options**\n\n1. Build from Source\n2. Use `Vagrantfile`\n3. Use `Dockerfile`\n\n### From Source\n\n```bash\n  git clone https://github.com/marak/oys\n  cd oys\n  npm install\n  npm start\n```\n\n*Note: You'll also need a CouchDB and Redis running on standard ports!*\n\n### Using Vagrant\n\n**TODO**\n\n ```bash\n git clone https://github.com/marak/oys\n cd oys\n vagrant up\n vagrant ssh\n cd oys\n npm start\n ```\n\n### Using Docker\n\n**TODO**\n\n\n## Server Usage\n\n*Express.js based server*. See: [https://github.com/bigcompany/http](https://github.com/bigcompany/http) for additional HTTP configuration API\n\n```js\nvar oys = require('oys');\noys.server.listen({ port: 4000 }, function (err, app) {\n  if (err) {\n    throw err;\n  }\n  console.log('listening on port ', app.server.address())\n});\n```\n\n## SDK Usage\n\n```js\n  var oys = require('oys');\n\n  var client = oys.createClient({\n    apiKey: '1234-5678'\n  });\n\n  // gets a specific secret value by key\n  oys.get('password', function (err, secret) {\n    console.log(err, secret);\n  });\n\n  // get multiple keys at once\n  oys.get(['password', 'another-password'], function (err, secrets) {\n    console.log(err, secrets);\n  });\n\n\n  oys.set('password', 'value', function (err, secret) {\n    console.log(err, secret);\n  });\n\n  // sets a specific secret value by key\n  // Note: not available for read-only roles ( no writing secret values from server )\n\n```\n\n## Middleware Usage\n\n```js\nvar oys =  require('oys');\nvar oysMiddle = oys.middle({});\napp.use('/_oys', oysMiddle);\n```\n\nThis will expose the following routes:\n\n```\nGET /_oys\nPOST /_oys\n```\n\n*These routes are capable of receiving push updates from an `oys` server or client.*\n\n## Roadmap\n\nsee: `RoadMap.md` file\n\n## What's the deal with the project name?\n\nIf you actually *look* at the name `Ocean Yet Storms` long enough, you might figure it out. If that doesn't work, try brushing up on your Robert Redford movies.\n\n## Contributors\n\n  - [Marak Squires](https://github.com/marak)\n  - [Armen Vartan](https://github.com/hippopotamus2)","starsCount":1,"created":"2016-06-02T04:36:37.920Z","modified":"2016-09-30T02:14:55.490Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"marak","email":"marak.squires@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"marak","email":"marak.squires@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"oys","_nodeVersion":"0.12.7","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/oys-1.0.0.tgz_1464842196716_0.14775206381455064"},"_npmUser":{"name":"marak","email":"marak.squires@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.11.3","_rev":"1-593fe3b4fd58be6e0624bfe86b0a62de","_shasum":"cba5babdf0ae97ef7bbb288c61c13a56611433ad","author":"","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Marak/oys/issues"},"directories":{"example":"examples","test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"cba5babdf0ae97ef7bbb288c61c13a56611433ad","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/oys/-/oys-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"marak","email":"marak.squires@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"ReadMe.md","time":{"modified":"2016-09-30T02:14:55.490Z","created":"2016-06-02T04:36:37.920Z","1.0.0":"2016-06-02T04:36:37.920Z"},"users":{"andrewtlove":true}}}
