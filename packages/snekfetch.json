snekfetch\n\nSnekfetch is a fast, efficient, and user-friendly library for making\nHTTP requests.\n\nThe API was inspired by superagent, and any methods that snekfetch has should\nbe dropin with superagent.\n\nDocumentation is available as JSDOC in `src/index.js`\n\n## Some examples\n\n```js\nconst snekfetch = require('snekfetch');\n\nsnekfetch.get('https://s.gus.host/o-SNAKES-80.jpg')\n  .then(r => fs.writeFile('download.jpg', r.body);\n\nsnekfetch.get('https://s.gus.host/o-SNAKES-80.jpg')\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('download.jpg'));\n```\n\n```js\nconst snekfetch = require('snekfetch');\n\nsnekfetch.post('https://httpbin.org/post')\n  .send({ meme: 'dream' })\n  .then(r => console.log(r.body));\n```\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2017-03-21T13:48:01.886Z","modified":"2017-06-15T04:30:29.548Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"snek","email":"me@gus.host"},"owners":[{"name":"crawl","email":"icrawltogo@gmail.com"},{"name":"hydrabolt","email":"amishshah.2k@gmail.com"},{"name":"snek","email":"me@gus.host"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"snekfetch","_nodeVersion":"8.1.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/snekfetch-3.1.11.tgz_1497501028276_0.8623030846938491"},"_npmUser":{"name":"snek","email":"me@gus.host"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.3","_rev":"35-b104c55c9bd9d867a99aaf463033d06d","author":{"name":"Gus
