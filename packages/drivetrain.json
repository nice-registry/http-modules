It's also a lightweight alternative to Selenium or PhantomJS because it speaks plain old HTTP and doesn't require spinning up a headless web browser.\n\nMore documentation is coming soon! In the meantime, check out the **examples** directory.\n","created":"2015-02-17T19:52:43.211Z","modified":"2015-04-04T06:20:17.515Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"azhawkes","email":"andy@andyhawkes.com"},"owners":[{"name":"azhawkes","email":"andy@andyhawkes.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"drivetrain","_nodeVersion":"0.10.33","_npmUser":{"name":"azhawkes","email":"andy@andyhawkes.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.5.1","_rev":"1-0d9cb4db41647abd779e0b87258b2de4","_shasum":"cbf6d6746cca15eb00518979ca302a7554fea47a","author":{"name":"Andy Hawkes","email":"andy@andyhawkes.com","url":"http://www.andyhawkes.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/azhawkes/drivetrain-js/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"cbf6d6746cca15eb00518979ca302a7554fea47a","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/drivetrain/-/drivetrain-0.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"azhawkes","email":"andy@andyhawkes.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-04-04T06:20:17.515Z","created":"2015-02-17T19:52:43.211Z","0.0.1":"2015-02-17T19:52:43.211Z","0.0.2":"2015-02-18T01:14:13.211Z","0.0.3":"2015-04-04T06:20:17.515Z"}}}
