Once node v0.12 comes out this library can be updated to use `child_process.execSync` and will become a much more efficient option.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n  MIT","starsCount":1,"created":"2014-01-11T15:37:35.990Z","modified":"2017-02-03T19:21:39.049Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"forbeslindesay","email":"forbes@lindeay.co.uk"},"owners":[{"name":"forbeslindesay","email":"forbes@lindesay.co.uk"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-sync-win","_npmUser":{"name":"forbeslindesay","email":"forbes@lindeay.co.uk"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.14","_rev":"2-0a6cfc228cddf7304c04f8685116ffbd","author":{"name":"ForbesLindesay"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/http-sync-win/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.7"},"dist":{"shasum":"f3fa8e22ddf03d292150d7eab029aef39b79a474","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-sync-win/-/http-sync-win-0.0.7.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"forbeslindesay","email":"forbes@lindesay.co.uk"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-02-03T19:21:39.049Z","created":"2014-01-11T15:37:35.990Z","0.0.1":"2014-01-11T15:37:36.857Z","0.0.4":"2014-01-11T15:58:03.079Z","0.0.5":"2014-01-12T21:54:20.528Z","0.0.6":"2014-01-12T22:03:57.293Z","0.0.7":"2014-01-28T17:24:12.341Z"},"users":{"pbhawsar":true}}}
