More testing in progress then we will release 1.0.\n\n## Features\n\n  - Rest Client with typescript generics and async/await/Promises\n  - Http Client with pipe stream support and async/await/Promises \n\n```javascript\nimport * as rm from 'typed-rest-client/RestClient';\n\nlet restc: rm.RestClient = new rm.RestClient('rest-samples', \n                                             'https://mystudentapiserver');\n\nlet res: rm.IRestResponse<Student> = await restc.get<Student>('/students/5');\n\nconsole.log(res.statusCode);\nconsole.log(res.result.name);\n```\n\n  - Typings included so no need to acquire separately (great for intellisense and no versioning drift)\n\n![intellisense](./docs/intellisense.png)\n\n  - Basic, Bearer and NTLM Support out of the box\n  - Proxy support\n  - Layered for Rest or Http use\n  - Full Samples and Tests included for usage\n\n## Install the library\n```\nnpm install typed-rest-client --save\n```\n\n## Samples\n\nSee [samples](./samples) for complete coding examples\n\n### Typings\n\nTypings (.d.ts) are distributed with the client, so intellisense and compile support just works from `tsc` and [vscode]()  \n\n## Pre-Requisites\n\nPre-req: prefer [Node 6.9.3 LTS](https://nodejs.org), minimum [Node >= 4.4.7 LTS](https://nodejs.org)\nTypings: `npm install typings -g`  \n\nOnce (or when dependencies change):  \n\n```bash\nnpm install\ntypings install\n```\n\n## Build \n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## Running Samples\n\nRun samples:  \n\n```bash\n$ npm run samples\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to this repository, see the [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
