If omitted, it's the same as the request host.\n* `port` (optional) : The origin port to proxy to. When both `host` and `port` are omitted, this acts as a loopback proxy, connecting back on to itself through the same request host and port; if a `host` is provided, this defaults to unset, and hence respect the HTTP implicit defaults, i.e. port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.\n* `protocol` (optional, `'http'|'https'`) : The protocol to use. If omitted, it's the same as the request protocol.\n* `translate` (optional) : A translation rule for the relative path of URL. This may be a two-element array of the form `[prefixPath, tranlatePrefixPath]`\nor `[regexPattern, translateTemplate]`, or a custom function with signature `function(url, urlSpec, request)` that returns a translated string URL.\nDefaults to no translation, i.e., same as request URL.\n* `timeout` (optional) : A timeout, in milliseconds, to wait for response from origin host. Default 5 minutes.\n* `access` (optional, `'plain'|'secure'|'any'`) : Limit incoming request access to `plain` or `secure` protocol only. Defaults to `any`.\nA redirect (302) to HTTPS response is sent if this is set to `secure` but incoming protocol is HTTP.\n* `debug` (optional, `true|false`) : Set to `true` to log useful debug information to console. Defaults to `false`.\n\n\nWhere `translate` is provided as a `function(url, urlSpec, request)`, the calling parameters are\n* `url` : The incoming relative request URL string.\n* `urlSpec` : The request URL specification of the form `{ host:, port:, protocol:, secure:, url: }`.\n* `request` : The request object as provided by Node.\n\n#### .vhost(config)\n#### .vhost().reset(config)\n#### .vhost().dispatcher\n*vhost documentation coming soon...*\n\n##License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Leonard Wu <leonard.wu92@alumni.ic.ac.uk>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
