By implementing the basis of the [Kademlia DHT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia), KadOH lets you build **distributed web applications** for mobile and desktop devices. With its flexible and extensible design, you can easily adapt KadOH to fit your needs. KadOH is available under the [MIT License](/jinroh/kadoh/blob/master/LICENSE). \n\nKadOH abstract many different [transport protocols](/jinroh/kadoh/wiki/Transport) to provide P2P connections. In the browser we support [XMPP over Bosh](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0206.html) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) shipped with a node.js router, and you can go for UDP and native XMPP in a node.js application. We plan to support **[WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/)** soon !\n\n[See the wiki](/jinroh/kadoh/wiki) for more informations ! Also take look at [our report](http://jinroh.github.com/kadoh) and be aware that this document may be outdated.\n\n---\n\n*Acknowledgments* — We would like to thank [Dr. Tudor Dumitraş](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~tdumitra/), who gave us the honor to work with him during our project and always made available his support.\n\n**[Alexandre Lachèze](/alexstrat/)** and **[Pierre Guilleminot](/jinroh/)**\n\n## See it in action\n\n**[Live demo](http://kadoh.fr.nf/)** based on XMPP transport running on Amazon EC2.\n\n### Run it yourself\n\nFirst you can start a little DHT based on UDP transport using this command :\n\n```\nbin/dht udp.default\n```\n\nThen in an other terminal, start the web-based [debug UI](/jinroh/kadoh/wiki/Debug-UI) using the following Jake command and go to `localhost:8080` :\n\n```sh\njake run:udp\n```\n\nSee the wiki for more informations on how to [launch your own DHT](/jinroh/kadoh/wiki/DHT-simulation) from scratch and on different environments.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install KadOH\n\nThe only required dependency is [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (version >= 0.6, but you clould try below..). Take a look at the [official manual](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager) to install node on your system.\n\nThen run :\n\n```sh\nnpm install kadoh\n# or: git clone https://github.com/jinroh/kadoh.git\ncd kadoh\nnpm install\n```\n\nYou may also want to install the Jake module globally :\n\n```\nnpm install -g jake\n```\n\n*For Linux users*, if the installation of KadOH's dependencies fails, you may need to install the `libexpat-dev` package. For Ubuntu/Debian users, run the following command :\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install libexpat-dev\n```\n\n### Build and go\n\n#### Browser\n\nTo build the source inside the `dist` folder run one of the following Jake command :\n\n```sh\njake build\n```\n\nThis will build two versions of KadOH supporting different transports :\n\n  - SimUDP using Socket.io\n  - XMPP using Strophe.js for XMPP over Bosh\n\n#### Node.js\n\nIf you need to use KadOH in a node.js application, just add `kadoh` in your package dependencies and use :\n\n```javascript\nvar kadoh = require('kadoh');\n```\n\n## Thanks\n\nKadOH is built on top of many open-source libraries and projects:\n\n  - [Strophe.js](http://strophe.im/strophejs/)\n  - [node-xmpp](https://github.com/astro/node-xmpp)\n  - [cube](https://github.com/square/cube)\n  - [klass](https://github.com/ded/klass)\n  - [bncode](https://github.com/a2800276/bencode.js)\n  - [socket.io](http://socket.io/)\n  - [express](http://expressjs.com/)\n  - [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)\n\n## Tests\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jinroh/kadoh.png?branch=master)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jinroh/kadoh?branch=master)\n\n*For the moment, tests are not running anymore.. But we hope that will be fixed as soon as we migrate to Mocha.*\n\n```\njake test:node\njake test:browser\n```\n","created":"2014-04-28T16:21:50.085Z","modified":"2014-04-28T16:26:16.516Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"kenansulayman","email":"kenan@sly.mn"},"owners":[{"name":"kenansulayman","email":"kenan@sly.mn"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"kadoh","_npmUser":{"name":"kenansulayman","email":"kenan@sly.mn"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.22","_rev":"1-4ff7fa655287d01165bac20876ca4848","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jinroh/kadoh/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Alexandre Lachèze","email":"alexandre.lacheze@gmail.com"},{"name":"Pierre Guilleminot","email":"pierre.guilleminot@gmail.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"1a7151d83c34bc1d5428f20803a10d51e3865229","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/kadoh/-/kadoh-0.1.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"kenansulayman","email":"kenan@sly.mn"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-04-28T16:26:16.516Z","created":"2014-04-28T16:21:50.085Z","0.1.0":"2014-04-28T16:21:50.085Z","0.1.1":"2014-04-28T16:26:16.516Z"}}}
