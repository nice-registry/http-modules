It has _many_ features.\n`pull-http-client` starts with the most general interface to http for pull-streams,\nand then gives you several helpers that are each more suited to particular ways http is often used.\n\n## request(opts, cb(err, source)) => sink\n\nThe most basic format. returns a sink stream, and takes a callback which will be called with an error, and a source stream.\n\n## request.source(opts, cb (err)) => source\n\nuse for downloads. the source is the response.\n\n## request.sink(opts, cb(err, data)) => sink\n\nuse for uploads. the sink will pull your uploads to the server.\n`data` will contain the headers\n\n## request.duplex(opts, cb(err, data)) => duplex\n\nYou probably won't need this. If you seem to need this, you should probably use websockets instead.\nSome proxies will make this not work properly, but node<->node this should work.\n\n## request.async(opts, cb(err, data))\n\nsometimes http is just a question and an answer. for smallish/fixed size responses\ndon't use streams at all. just ask a question and get an answer.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n","created":"2016-03-22T04:38:18.455Z","modified":"2016-03-22T05:06:47.458Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"dominictarr","email":"dominic.tarr@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"dominictarr","email":"dominic.tarr@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"pull-http-client","_nodeVersion":"5.6.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-13-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/pull-http-client-0.0.1.tgz_1458623206962_0.3672441674862057"},"_npmUser":{"name":"dominictarr","email":"dominic.tarr@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.6.0","_rev":"1-f4ecc9c584d6a78b3281e37e8c395154","_shasum":"cf910169a118f368e5d4ea5a13e54a7ff6e10146","author":{"name":"Dominic Tarr","email":"dominic.tarr@gmail.com","url":"http://dominictarr.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dominictarr/pull-http-client/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"cf910169a118f368e5d4ea5a13e54a7ff6e10146","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/pull-http-client/-/pull-http-client-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"dominictarr","email":"dominic.tarr@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-03-22T05:06:47.458Z","created":"2016-03-22T04:38:18.455Z","0.0.0":"2016-03-22T04:38:18.455Z","0.0.1":"2016-03-22T05:06:47.458Z"}}}
