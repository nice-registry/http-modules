Extends anvil with functionality to allow other plugins to host features and content.\n\nThis plugin requires anvil.js version 0.8.* or greater.\n\n## Installation\n\n\tanvil install anvil.http\n\n## Usage\n\n\tanvil --host\n\n## Configuration\nConfiguration can be changed by adding any of the three properties to the build file under \"anvil.http\": {}.\n\n### \"contentTypes\"\nA hash where the key is the extension of the requested file and the value is the mimeType specification. In general, this is only necessary if you're adding support for a file extension that needs to be compiled on the fly. \n\nExample:\n\t\"contentTypes\": { \n\t\t\".coffee\": \"application/javascript\"\n\t}\n\n### \"port\"\nSpecifies what port the server will listen to. The default is 3080.\n\nExample:\n\n\t\"port\": 3080\n\t\t\t\n### \"paths\"\nA hash where the key is the relative url to map to a specific directory or file. The following example shows the default setting which causes the output directory to get mapped to the top level.\n\nExample:\n\t\t\t\n\t\"paths\": {\n\t\t\"/\": anvil.config.output\n\t}\n\n## API\nCurrently the only call that this plugin adds to anvil is registerPath.\n\n### registerPath( url, filePath )\nThis lets you register static files to serve at a specific relative url","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2012-08-03T05:44:18.264Z"},{"number":"0.0.3","date":"2012-09-10T05:28:45.878Z"},{"number":"0.0.5","date":"2012-10-04T22:57:20.865Z"},{"number":"0.0.6","date":"2012-10-05T06:55:34.677Z"},{"number":"0.0.7","date":"2012-10-17T04:51:35.403Z"},{"number":"0.1.1","date":"2012-12-20T06:53:03.091Z"}],"created":"2012-08-03T05:44:17.532Z","modified":"2012-12-20T06:53:03.091Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"a_robson","email":"alex@sharplearningcurve.com"},"owners":[{"name":"a_robson","email":"alex@sharplearningcurve.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"anvil.http","_npmUser":{"name":"a_robson","email":"alex@sharplearningcurve.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.65","_rev":"1-49cb1ae15572a2852384ae5823c6d130","author":{"name":"Alex Robson","email":"alex@sharplearningcurve.com","url":"http://sharplearningcurve.com"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"1bd37d20c39c685407f7bbd19f3793a17a833779","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/anvil.http/-/anvil.http-0.1.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"a_robson","email":"alex@sharplearningcurve.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2012-12-20T06:53:03.091Z","created":"2012-08-03T05:44:17.532Z","0.0.1":"2012-08-03T05:44:18.264Z","0.0.3":"2012-09-10T05:28:45.878Z","0.0.5":"2012-10-04T22:57:20.865Z","0.0.6":"2012-10-05T06:55:34.677Z","0.0.7":"2012-10-17T04:51:35.403Z","0.1.1":"2012-12-20T06:53:03.091Z"}}}
