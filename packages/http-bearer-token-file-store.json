It does not really\nwarrant full blown security system but you want to protect it anyways. This is\na good use case for this npm module, combined with Jared Hanson's bearer token module (https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-http-bearer)\n\n## Install\n\nnpm install http-bearer-token-file-store\n\n## Usage (Coffeescript)\n  \nCreate a token file (like the one on examples/config/access-tokens.json). \n\n\thttpBearerTokenFileStore = require 'http-bearer-token-file-store'\n\tpath = require 'path'\n\t\n\tpathToTokenFile = path.join __dirname ,\"./config/access-tokens.json\"\n\t@bearerTokenStore = httpBearerTokenFileStore.store pathToTokenFile\n\t\nNow you can use the \n\n\t @bearerTokenStore.isValid token, (err,valid,scopes) ->\n\t @bearerTokenStore.isValidAndInScope token,scope, (err,valid,scopes) ->\n\nmethods. The first one checks if the token exists, but does not perform a scope\ncheck. The second one checks if the token is in the scope passed along. The scope\ncan be null, an string, an array of one string, an array of many strings (all must be met).\n\n## Token File format\n\n\t[{ \"token\" : \"some-token\", \"scopes\" : [\"http://publicschema.org/scopes/admin\"]  },\n\t\"another-token\"]\n\nThe token file must be a valid json file, with an array at the root, and can consist of two kind of entries, either a simple string (\"another-token\") or an object with a \"token\" and a \"scopes\" property, where \"token\" must be a string and \"scopes\" an array of zero or more scopes.\n\nWhen loading invalid content from a valid json file it will callback with an error.\n\n## Check out\n\n* https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport\n\nfor a comprehensive authentication solution for node.js\n\n## Advertising :)\n\nCheck out \n\n* http://scottyapp.com\n\nFollow us on Twitter at \n\n* @getscottyapp\n* @martin_sunset\n\nand like us on Facebook please.

This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.\n* Please try not to mess with the package.json, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 ScottyApp, Inc.
