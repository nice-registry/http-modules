Actually starting and running servers along with dispatching requests is slow and prone to errors.\n\nVine Hill allows you to \"start\" a server virutally and connect it with your client code by installing a bridge between XmlHttpRequest and your server. This allows the server to respond to requests in the same process as your client code and tests are running.\n\nWhat you get is high performance tests with easy to ready stacktraces and great debugability.\n\n# Get started\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\napp.get('/weather/:city', (req, res) => {\n  res.json({\n    city: req.params.city,\n    temp: '22C'\n  });\n});\n\n\n// connect your app to a host name\nvar vineHill = require('vinehill');\n\n// for a single server\nvineHill({'http://weather.com': app});\n\n// or for multiple servers\n// vineHill({\n//   'http://weather.com': app,\n//   'http://other.com': otherApp\n// })\n\n\nvar httpism = require('httpism/browser');\nhttpism.get('http://weather.com/weather/london').then(response => {\n  console.log(response.body.temp);\n});\n```\n\n# Logging\n\nVinehill logs requests/responses using the excellent [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) module\nTo log in the console set the `DEBUG` env variable to `vinehill*` and then run your tests.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nDEBUG=vinehill* mocha\n```\n\nIf you are using vinehill in a browser then you can enable logging by running this code in the console (or before vinehill is required)\n\n```js\nlocalStorage.debug = 'vinehill*'\n```\nYou can further filter logging by replacing `vinehill*`:\n - `vinehill` only logs a simplified `METHOD: URL STATUS => STATUSTEXT` eg. `PUT: http://server1/some/file.txt => 200 OK`\n- `vinehill:request` only log request objects\n- `vinehill:response` only log response objects\n- `vinehill*` log request, response and simplified version\n\n# Browser support\n\n* Chrome\n* Firefox\n* IE 11\n* IE Edge\n\n## Unsupported Browsers\n\nSafari:\n  SyntaxError: Cannot declare a parameter named 'error' as it shadows the name of a strict mode function.\n  at /tmp/derek/node_modules/send/index.js:272:0\n\nIE10:\n  Object doesn't support property or method 'use'\n  at /tmp/derek/node_modules/express/lib/application.js:143:0\n","created":"2016-11-04T22:10:00.929Z","modified":"2017-05-18T12:27:37.146Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"dereke","email":"derek@spathi.com"},"owners":[{"name":"adiel","email":"adrian.longley@gmail.com"},{"name":"alecrust","email":"me@alecrust.com"},{"name":"artemave","email":"artemave+npm@gmail.com"},{"name":"dereke","email":"derek@spathi.com"},{"name":"joshski","email":"josh@featurist.co.uk"},{"name":"refractalize","email":"timmacfarlane@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"vinehill","_nodeVersion":"7.6.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/vinehill-0.13.0.tgz_1495110455354_0.1661935462616384"},"_npmUser":{"name":"dereke","email":"derek@spathi.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.5.0","_rev":"22-eaf7d6d9a89cecaefcc2bdc4e6621d10","_shasum":"e23ae388c3bc73087ac0602a95c15cc3e28cdda9","author":{"name":"Derek Ekins"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dereke/vinehill/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.13.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"e23ae388c3bc73087ac0602a95c15cc3e28cdda9","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/vinehill/-/vinehill-0.13.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"adiel","email":"adrian.longley@gmail.com"},{"name":"alecrust","email":"me@alecrust.com"},{"name":"artemave","email":"artemave+npm@gmail.com"},{"name":"dereke","email":"derek@spathi.com"},{"name":"joshski","email":"josh@featurist.co.uk"},{"name":"refractalize","email":"timmacfarlane@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"Readme.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-18T12:27:37.146Z","created":"2016-11-04T22:10:00.929Z","0.0.1":"2016-11-04T22:10:00.929Z","0.0.2":"2016-11-04T23:54:30.791Z","0.0.3":"2016-11-04T23:58:34.690Z","0.0.4":"2016-11-15T23:06:59.300Z","0.1.0":"2016-11-24T13:45:00.914Z","0.2.0":"2016-11-24T14:37:26.669Z","0.3.0":"2016-11-25T21:55:27.822Z","0.4.0":"2016-12-11T22:32:48.608Z","0.4.1":"2016-12-12T00:32:14.391Z","0.5.0":"2016-12-14T10:24:53.881Z","0.6.0":"2017-02-13T14:50:30.640Z","0.7.0":"2017-02-15T09:18:22.087Z","0.7.1":"2017-02-23T07:56:33.745Z","0.7.2":"2017-02-25T06:18:03.863Z","0.8.0":"2017-03-04T00:18:55.247Z","0.9.0":"2017-03-07T09:08:58.118Z","0.10.0":"2017-03-28T21:50:49.117Z","0.11.0":"2017-05-17T14:16:36.696Z","0.12.0":"2017-05-18T10:05:54.784Z","0.13.0":"2017-05-18T12:27:37.146Z"}}}
