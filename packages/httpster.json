If you want to change the port or directory that the server runs from pass in the -p or -d options\n\n    httpster -p 8080 -d /home/somedir/public_html\n\n### HTML5 Pushstates\n\nIf you want to run a local site that supports HTML5 Pushstates (aka being able to refresh the page), pass in the option `-s` or `--pushstate`. This will map all 4oh4's to the `index.html` you specified as root directory.\n\n### Basic Authentication\n\nSince you can use httpster to deploy to PaaS providers like heroku you can now secure those deployments with basic authentication.  The `-b` or `--basic_auth` options will read the HTTPSTER_AUTH_USER and HTTPSTER_AUTH_PASS variables from your environment for authentication.\n\n    httpster -b\nor\n    httpster --basic_auth\n\nIf testing this locally you can also use a .env file in the directory you will run httpster from.\n\n    HTTPSTER_AUTH_USER=desired_username\n    HTTPSTER_AUTH_PASS=desired_password\n\nThen use the `-e` or `--env` option to specify to load the environmental variables\n\n    httpster --env --basic_auth\n\n### Contributions\n\nIf you have some issue please feel free to add a ticket here. If you have any suggestions for features that would make this more useful please feel free to let me know.\n\nThanks to @GarthDB for asking for this and making me realize that I needed it too.\n","starsCount":11,"created":"2012-04-21T05:26:12.439Z","modified":"2017-04-08T16:03:32.085Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"simbco","email":"simeon@simb.co"},"owners":[{"name":"simbco","email":"simeon@simb.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"httpster","_nodeVersion":"4.2.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-6-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/httpster-1.0.3.tgz_1454609710133_0.5195376605261117"},"_npmUser":{"name":"simbco","email":"simeon@simb.co"},"_npmVersion":"3.5.2","_rev":"5-660079bc199b5a95bf84b579f7888a5b","_shasum":"9430b7a7ddf3112c7b956ce7d99252901e05d83a","author":{"name":"Simeon Bateman","email":"simeon@simb.net","url":"http://www.simb.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/SimbCo/httpster/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"9430b7a7ddf3112c7b956ce7d99252901e05d83a","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/httpster/-/httpster-1.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"simbco","email":"simeon@simb.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-08T16:03:32.085Z","created":"2012-04-21T05:26:12.439Z","0.1.0":"2012-04-21T05:26:13.632Z","0.2.0":"2012-12-03T17:18:36.945Z","0.2.1":"2012-12-03T20:53:03.596Z","0.3.0":"2012-12-05T00:31:16.062Z","0.3.1":"2012-12-10T21:12:23.581Z","0.3.2":"2013-01-14T21:01:21.808Z","0.4.0":"2013-02-05T00:29:06.034Z","0.5.0":"2013-06-21T18:14:34.771Z","0.5.1":"2013-06-21T18:22:32.839Z","0.5.2":"2013-06-21T18:41:41.310Z","0.6.0":"2013-08-21T17:03:35.613Z","0.7.0":"2014-10-27T23:18:32.169Z","0.9.0":"2014-10-28T17:11:07.983Z","1.0.0":"2014-10-29T05:23:05.551Z","1.0.1":"2015-01-15T16:58:06.681Z","1.0.3":"2016-02-04T18:15:11.214Z"},"users":{"nosch":true,"ballpointpenguin":true,"jmsherry":true,"geese98":true,"davidazullo":true,"tomtomaso":true,"meligatt":true,"thehatchcloud":true,"da5atar":true,"escapeimagery":true,"adhamfarrag":true}}}
