This is useful for developers who want to try out the Windows Azure REST API without having to deal with authentication. By running wazproxy and proxying web requests through it, you can use simple tools like `curl` or even a web browser to interact with Windows Azure storage.\n\nWazproxy is also useful for adapting existing apps to work with Windows Azure storage. For example, if you have an application that can consume a\ngeneric OData feed but doesn't support Windows Azure storage authentication, you can start wazproxy, change your proxy settings, and use the application as-is.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n`npm install wazproxy -g`\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    Usage: wazproxy.js [options]\n    \n      Options:\n    \n        -h, --help               output usage information\n        -V, --version            output the version number\n        -a, --account [account]  storage account name\n        -k, --key [key]          storage account key\n        -p, --port [port]        port (defaults to 8080)\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThe following will list all the tables in the given account:\n\n    wazproxy -a <account> -k <key>\n    set http_proxy=127.0.0.1:8080\n    curl <account>.table.core.windows.net/tables\n\nOn Linux or OS X, use `export` instead of `set`.\n\nThe following will create a container (private, by default), upload a text blob into it, retrieve the blob, and finally delete the container.\n\n    curl <account>.blob.core.windows.net/testcontainer?restype=container -X PUT -d \"\"\n    curl <account>.blob.core.windows.net/testcontainer/testblob -X PUT -d \"hello world\" -H \"content-type:text/plain\" -H \"x-ms-blob-type:BlockBlob\"\n    curl <account>.blob.core.windows.net/testcontainer/testblob\n    # output: \"hello world\"\n    curl <account>.blob.core.windows.net/testcontainer?restype=container -X DELETE\n\nThe following will peek at a queue message:\n\n    curl <account>.queue.core.windows.net/myqueue/messages?peekonly=true\n\nFor the full details of the Windows Azure storage API, see the [\"Windows Azure Storage Services REST API Reference\" on MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dd179355.aspx).\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nWazproxy only proxies HTTP requests (not HTTPS). Any request that's not addressed to `<account>.(blob|table|queue).core.windows.net` is simply passed through unmodified, so you can proxy all traffic through wazproxy (including, for example, traffic from other browser tabs).\n\nWazproxy does not support the storage emulator, but pull requests are welcome.\n","versions":[{"number":"1.0.0","date":"2012-10-17T04:47:10.958Z"},{"number":"1.0.1","date":"2012-10-17T04:53:05.882Z"}],"created":"2012-10-17T04:47:09.704Z","modified":"2012-10-17T04:53:05.882Z","owners":[{"name":"smarx","email":"smarx@smarx.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"wazproxy","_rev":"1-8eb218c674f4d704e6a8b383b1d55af9","author":{"name":"Steve Marx","email":"smarx@smarx.com"},"contributors":[{"name":"Steve Marx","email":"smarx@smarx.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"f7dfd3c82e25f9a50d1453e3c0793ffd40bd22c6","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/wazproxy/-/wazproxy-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"smarx","email":"smarx@smarx.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2012-10-17T04:53:05.882Z","created":"2012-10-17T04:47:09.704Z","1.0.0":"2012-10-17T04:47:10.958Z","1.0.1":"2012-10-17T04:53:05.882Z"}}}
