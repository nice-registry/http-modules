(e.g. RDF)\n\n\n* A main goal is to design a content management system, thats it, the system should not care how the content is consumed.\n* The content should be exposed through web services, and can be consumed by javascript, ios, etc\n* The backend must be flexible, we need to be able to swap out data storage modules\n* there should be an optional data caching module. again, it should be able to be swapped out.\n* The UI should be based on bootstrap, or something similar, we can also use ASP.NET MVC for the quick Admin UI\n\n\n\n# Why?\n* Most Content Management systems out there provide some crazy way to get the content from the system, to the site, this is a waste when you want full control over how content is rendered, so why not just have an admin export the content as web services?\n","created":"2013-02-11T12:28:06.886Z","modified":"2013-02-11T12:28:09.029Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"alex.lapinski","email":"npm@alexlapinski.name"},"owners":[{"name":"alex.lapinski","email":"npm@alexlapinski.name"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"drasil","_nodeVersion":"v0.6.19","_npmUser":{"name":"alex.lapinski","email":"npm@alexlapinski.name"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.4","_rev":"1-c54b4f5ecb99852ebecf57636e1b4a9e","author":{"name":"Alex Lapinski","email":"drasil@alexlapinski.name"},"contributors":[{"name":"Alex Lapinski","email":"contact@alexlapinski.name"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"69a514113e54311ad32ab63bc74cf59b3dfe9fa9","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/drasil/-/drasil-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"alex.lapinski","email":"npm@alexlapinski.name"}],"time":{"modified":"2013-02-11T12:28:09.029Z","created":"2013-02-11T12:28:06.886Z","0.0.1":"2013-02-11T12:28:09.029Z"}}}
