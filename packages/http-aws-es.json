It uses the aws-sdk to make signed requests to an Amazon ES endpoint.\n\n## Installation\n```bash\n# Install the connector, elasticsearch client and aws-sdk\nnpm install --save http-aws-es aws-sdk elasticsearch\n```\n\n## Usage\n```javascript\n// configure the region for aws-sdk\nlet AWS = require('aws-sdk');\nAWS.config.update({ region: 'us-east-1' });\n\n// create an elasticsearch client for your Amazon ES\nvar es = require('elasticsearch').Client({\n  hosts: [ 'https://amazon-es-host.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com:80' ],\n  connectionClass: require('http-aws-es')\n});\n```\n\n## Credentials\nThe connector uses aws-sdk's default credential behaviour to obtain credentials from your environment. If you would like to set credentials manually, you can set them on aws-sdk:\n\n```javascript\nAWS.config.update({\n  credentials: new AWS.Credentials(accessKeyId, secretAccessKey)\n});\n```\n\n## Test\n```bash\nnpm run test -- --endpoint https://amazon-es-host.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com:80 --region us-east-1\n```\n","starsCount":3,"created":"2015-10-04T15:40:33.279Z","modified":"2017-06-20T19:04:44.582Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"thedeveloper","email":"geoff@gosquared.com"},"owners":[{"name":"thedeveloper","email":"geoff@gosquared.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-aws-es","_nodeVersion":"6.10.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/http-aws-es-2.0.3.tgz_1497985483671_0.7860601546708494"},"_npmUser":{"name":"thedeveloper","email":"geoff@gosquared.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"6-32dd05f42d8c2264052dbdf8868e405f","_shasum":"73857e0332082b7c4ef7d59bb865d40ad3a9dec2","author":{"name":"Geoff Wagstaff","email":"geoff@gosquared.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/TheDeveloper/http-aws-es/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"73857e0332082b7c4ef7d59bb865d40ad3a9dec2","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/http-aws-es/-/http-aws-es-2.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"thedeveloper","email":"geoff@gosquared.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-20T19:04:44.582Z","created":"2015-10-04T15:40:33.279Z","1.0.0":"2015-10-04T15:40:33.279Z","1.0.1":"2015-10-04T15:48:03.855Z","1.0.2":"2015-10-04T15:52:14.522Z","1.1.0":"2015-10-19T07:37:45.317Z","1.1.1":"2015-10-19T07:40:17.185Z","1.1.2":"2015-10-27T15:24:04.111Z","1.1.3":"2015-12-01T12:29:29.596Z","2.0.0":"2017-06-20T18:30:11.545Z","2.0.1":"2017-06-20T18:59:49.633Z","2.0.2":"2017-06-20T19:02:33.279Z","2.0.3":"2017-06-20T19:04:44.582Z"},"users":{"hengkiardo":true,"esperluette":true,"anotheri":true}}}
