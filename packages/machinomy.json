It allows you to send and receive a minuscule\namount of money instantly.\n\nWeb site: [machinomy.com](http://machinomy.com).\nTwitter: [@machinomy](http://twitter.com).\nSupport/Discussion: [Gitter](https://gitter.im/machinomy/machinomy).\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe website contains [Getting Started](http://machinomy.com/documentation/getting-started/) guide.\nIt is more illustrative than instructions below.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install -g machinomy\n    \nAssumptions:\n* [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) node runs on `http://localhost:8545`,\n* geth runs [Ropsten](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/20/from-morden-to-ropsten/) network.\n\nThe library supports currently Ropsten network only. It is early days, we would like to avoid\nlosses by mistake on your side. Ether on Ropsten cost nothing. One could get some from [ZeroGox Faucet](https://zerogox.com/ethereum/wei_faucet) for free.\n\n## Set up\n\nTo only play with CLI a command below is enough:\n\n    $ machinomy setup\n    \nIf you also intend to _sell_ services via HTTP, set up \"receiver\" side:\n  \n    $ machinomy setup --namespace receiver\n    \n## Usage\n\n### Buy\n\n    $ machinomy buy http://playground.machinomy.com/hello\n    \nBuys a service provided by a respective endpoint. You could buy the service from JavaScript as well:\n\n```javascript\n'use strict'\n\nconst machinomy = require('machinomy')\nconst uri = 'http://playground.machinomy.com/hello'\n\nconst settings = machinomy.configuration.sender()\nmachinomy.buy(uri, settings.account, settings.password).then(contents => {\n  console.log(contents)\n}).catch(error => {\n  throw error\n})\n```\n\n### Sell\n\nMachinomy allows you to sell a service over HTTP. The library provides [Express](http://expressjs.com) middleware\nto abstract details of payment handling from the business logic.\n\nA code like below runs on `http://playground.machinomy.com/hello`:\n\n```javascript\n\"use strict\";\n\nconst express    = require(\"express\"),\n      bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\"),\n      machinomy  = require(\"machinomy\");\n\nconst BASE = \"http://localhost:3000\";\n\nconst settings = machinomy.configuration.receiver();\nlet paywall = new machinomy.Paywall(settings.account, BASE);\n\nlet app = express();\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\napp.use(paywall.middleware());\n\napp.get(\"/hello\", paywall.guard(1000, function (req, res) {\n    res.write(\"Have just received 1000 wei.\\n\");\n    res.end(\"Hello, meat world!\");\n}));\n\napp.listen(8080, function(_) {\n    console.log(`Waiting at ${BASE}/hello ...`);\n});\n```\n    \nYou could test it with `machinomy buy` command described above.\n\n## Contributing\n\n**Developers:** Machinomy is for you. Feel free to use it, break it, fork it, and make the world better. The code is plain old JavaScript, no special skills required. \n\n**Non-Developers:** You are lovely. As a starter, help us spread the word! Tell a friend right now.\nIf not enough, developers need flesh-world guidance. It starts with proper documentation and a pinch of fantasy.\nReally anything, whether it is a short post on a use case of IoT micropayments, addition to the documentation (code comments, yay!),\nor an elaborate analysis of machine economy implications.
