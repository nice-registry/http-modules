It passes this filename into [raml-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raml-parser) to generate an AST of the API resources.\n\nWhile iterating through each API resource identified in the RAML document, it will create [Express](http://expressjs.com/) routes, and start-up a HTTP web server that will respond to any routes described by the RAML specification, with the example representations specified by the RAML specification.\n\nOptionally, each HTTP request may specify the `X-Mock-Result` header to indicate which response code is desired as the response. If the status code specified in this header is not specified by the RAML document, the server will return a 400 error with a plain-text message.\n","created":"2015-03-11T22:49:47.685Z","modified":"2015-03-12T15:47:33.397Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"thizzle","email":"me@tharsan.com"},"owners":[{"name":"thizzle","email":"me@tharsan.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ramlmock","_nodeVersion":"0.10.36","_npmUser":{"name":"thizzle","email":"me@tharsan.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.3.0","_rev":"1-30742b439947c91eefc12552426d3dbb","_shasum":"6c72b1d4809b22b5db262a19d8e6d1649da18667","author":{"name":"Tharsan Bhuvanendran","email":"me@tharsan.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/thizzle/ramlmock/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"6c72b1d4809b22b5db262a19d8e6d1649da18667","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ramlmock/-/ramlmock-1.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"thizzle","email":"me@tharsan.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-03-12T15:47:33.397Z","created":"2015-03-11T22:49:47.685Z","1.0.0":"2015-03-11T22:49:47.685Z","1.0.1":"2015-03-11T23:01:21.945Z","1.0.2":"2015-03-12T15:47:33.397Z"}}}
