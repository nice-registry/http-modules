It's simple, lightweight and familiar!\n\n`Quicksort.io framework` supports both experienced programmers and newbies to develop `node.js` application in a structured way and easy to maintain.\n\nIt's used to build real-time applications, user activity tracking systems, chat applications and it's good for any web application project.\n\n\n# Hello world example\n\n## 1. Creating a Controller\nTo get started, let's create a Controller to handler requests by creating new `home-controller.js` file in `/controllers` directory\n\n    module.exports = HomeController;\n    function HomeController() {\n        this.helloworld = function (io) {\n            io.echo(\"hello world\");\n        };\n    }\n\n## 2. Routing\nRouting http requests to the above controller. Open `/start/routes.js` file and add the following route:\n\n    route.get(\"/\", \"HomeController@helloworld\");\n\n## 3. Launching it\nStart the server:\n\n    node app.js \n\nand send a http request, then it should print out: \"hello world\"\n\n    curl http://localhost:2307/\n\n# Installation\n`Quicksort.io` framework is easy to install:\n\n1. Cloning the project: `$ git clone https://github.com/megaads-vn/quicksort.io`\n\n2. Changing current directory to project directory: `$ cd quicksort.io`\n\n3. Installing dependencies: `$ npm install`\n\n4. Finally, let's start: `$ node app.js`\n\n# Directory structure\n\n## `/assets`\n\nThe directory contains resource files.\n\n## `/config`\n\nAs the name imples, cantains all application configurations such as: application port, debug mode, session configuration, autoload class map, service providers, etc.\n\n## `/controllers`\n\nThe default directory contains application controllers.\n\nBy default, all controllers in this directory will be loaded automatically at booting time that configured as autoload directory in `config.app` file.\n\n## `/core`\n\nThe directory contains core modules of the framework. \n\nExploring it and you can learn about the framework's activity mechanism.\n\n## `/libs`\n\nThird-party libraries should be stored in this drectory.\n\n## `/services`\n\nAn autoloaded directory that used  as default directory for service classes.\n\n## `/start`\n\nThe directory loaded automatically at booting time\n\nYou will want to set start parameters in this. Including routes, event listeners or anything that configured as autoloaded directory , etc.\n\n## `/storage`\n\nThe directory contains session files, logs, compiled files by the framework and by included libraries. \n\nThis directory may be used to store any files utilized by your application.\n\n## `/tests`\n\nUnit test classes should be stored in this directory.\n\n# Configuration\n# Autoload class map\n# Routing\n# Filters\n# Controllers\n# Inputs and Responses\n# Session\n#IoC\n#Services\n# Events\n# Logger","starsCount":1,"created":"2016-02-26T03:46:51.282Z","modified":"2016-02-26T03:46:51.282Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"phult","email":"phult.contact@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"phult","email":"phult.contact@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"quicksort.io","_nodeVersion":"4.1.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-9-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/quicksort.io-0.7.1.tgz_1456458410360_0.626915963832289"},"_npmUser":{"name":"phult","email":"phult.contact@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.3.6","_rev":"1-3ed46900c12d1c5412dc16a8907cd60a","_shasum":"82c040641f6ded79f130b4951e0ed5ab437c1e78","author":{"name":"Megaads","email":"info.megaads@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/megaads-vn/quicksort.io/issues"},"contributors":[],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.7.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"82c040641f6ded79f130b4951e0ed5ab437c1e78","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/quicksort.io/-/quicksort.io-0.7.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"phult","email":"phult.contact@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-02-26T03:46:51.282Z","created":"2016-02-26T03:46:51.282Z","0.7.1":"2016-02-26T03:46:51.282Z"},"users":{"megaads":true}}}
