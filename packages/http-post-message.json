The enables communicating with iframes in a well known protocol and pattern.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g http-post-message\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThe HttpPostMessage takes in an object that implements the IPostMessage interface which\r\nis just one method `postMessage` which returns a Promise.\r\n\r\nIn the case below we created a mock postMessage proxy, but in normal usage you would likely use the accompanying library [window-post-message-proxy](https://pbix.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/PaaS/_git/window-post-message-proxy).\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport * as hpm from 'http-post-message';\r\n\r\nconst stubWindowPostMessageProxy: hpm.IPostMessage = {\r\n  postMessage(message: any) {\r\n    console.log(message);\r\n    return Promise.resolve(message):\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst httpPostMessage = new hpm.HttpPostMessage(stubWindowPostMessageProxy);\r\n\r\nhttpPostMessage.get('target/path')\r\n  .then(response => {\r\n    ...\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Methods\r\nThe object supports all the standard http methods, `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, and `delete`.\r\nYou can also send an `IRequest` object directly to the lower-level `send` method.\r\n\r\n","created":"2016-06-23T20:20:41.106Z","modified":"2016-08-27T20:17:44.301Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"powerbi","email":"nugetpowerbi@microsoft.com"},"owners":[{"name":"powerbi","email":"nugetpowerbi@microsoft.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-post-message","_nodeVersion":"6.4.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http-post-message-0.2.3.tgz_1472329063241_0.4381651943549514"},"_npmUser":{"name":"powerbi","email":"nugetpowerbi@microsoft.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.3","_rev":"1-d1b529129f8356850ab7745896a92d4c","_shasum":"32c560ac615f310a7e459ffc71277b579b242e1e","author":{"name":"Microsoft Power BI"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/http-post-message/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"beta":"0.2.3","latest":"0.2.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"32c560ac615f310a7e459ffc71277b579b242e1e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-post-message/-/http-post-message-0.2.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"powerbi","email":"nugetpowerbi@microsoft.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-08-27T20:17:44.301Z","created":"2016-06-23T20:20:41.106Z","0.1.0":"2016-06-23T20:20:41.106Z","0.1.1":"2016-06-24T19:55:15.958Z","0.1.2":"2016-06-30T01:11:47.059Z","0.2.0":"2016-07-05T19:48:35.120Z","0.2.1":"2016-07-13T16:52:00.766Z","0.2.2":"2016-08-05T22:35:40.946Z","0.2.3":"2016-08-27T20:17:44.301Z"}}}
