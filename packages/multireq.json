The idea is to make http request from the client in one batch, so we reduce the number of HTTP request coming from the SPA and return all the requested information into a single JSON object. The middleware will take the request to a defined path (e.g 'api/multi?[params]) and then it will tell the app to do those requests locally. By doing this, we do not need to know anything about the express app, just the endpoints where we can get the information from.\n\n## Example\n\nFor example. If we have an express app that has the following endpoints:\n\n    GET api/users\n    GET api/customers/:id\n    GET api/countries\n\nAnd we want to make only one HTTP request to get all the information in a batch, then this middleware will allow us to do the following:\n\n\t\tGET api/multi?users=api/users&customer=api/customers/23&countries=api/countries\n\nThis above request will have a return that looks like this:\n\n    {\n    \tusers: { ... }, // the list of users returned by the endpoint 'api/users'\n    \tcustomer: { ... }, // the customer with id 23\n    \tcountries: { ... } // the list of the countries returned by the endpoint 'api/countries'\n    }\n\nWe assume it has been run through some middleware like express.bodyParser() or express.json() to parse the requests\n\n## How to install it?\n\nInstall with:\n\n    npm install multireq\n\n## How do I use it?\n\nAfter you install, just include the module in your express app with the follwing line:\n\n    var multireq = require('multireq');\n\nAnd then after your app has been run thorugh the required middlewares, run:\n\n    app.use('/api/multi', multireq);\n\nThe line above will generate the '/api/multi' route for your express app which will batch the request send as params\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-01-15T13:56:08.834Z","modified":"2015-01-16T22:53:28.793Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tagisen","email":"isenbeqiri@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"tagisen","email":"isenbeqiri@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"multireq","_npmUser":{"name":"tagisen","email":"isenbeqiri@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.23","_rev":"1-283156956ea9dce38b9fd4a7de308be2","_shasum":"36e57439801b60cf50b4ba76ece9999fa173cdc5","author":{"name":"Isen Beqiri","email":"isenbeqiri@gmail.comnpm adduser"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/isenbeqiri/multireq/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.9"},"dist":{"shasum":"36e57439801b60cf50b4ba76ece9999fa173cdc5","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/multireq/-/multireq-0.0.9.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tagisen","email":"isenbeqiri@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.markdown","time":{"modified":"2015-01-16T22:53:28.793Z","created":"2015-01-15T13:56:08.834Z","0.0.1":"2015-01-15T13:56:08.834Z","0.0.2":"2015-01-15T18:56:29.548Z","0.0.3":"2015-01-15T20:49:32.857Z","0.0.4":"2015-01-15T21:15:53.317Z","0.0.5":"2015-01-15T21:27:48.656Z","0.0.6":"2015-01-16T11:10:44.909Z","0.0.7":"2015-01-16T20:31:05.755Z","0.0.8":"2015-01-16T22:38:55.791Z","0.0.9":"2015-01-16T22:53:28.793Z"},"users":{"tagisen":true}}}
