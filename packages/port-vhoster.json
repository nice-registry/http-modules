This is the port you want to enable port sharing for (e.g. 80)\n- vhosts      = An object containing key ($ip OR $domain/port) and a value (target $ip:$port/$path)\n\n## Configuration example\n\nThe following configuration is a simple routing example. You can add more vhosts to the object\nand register more complex routings (domain name, ip, path) too:\n\n```\n\n    {\n        \"description\": \"For example routing all HTTP requests of port 8100 to localhost:8080...\",\n        \"port\": 8100,\n        \"vhosts\": {\n            \"localhost\": \"127.0.0.1:8080\"\n        }\n    }\n\n```\n\nBy default you should save the config as plain text file called ```port-vhoster.json```.\n\n## Running the port sharing proxy\n\nDead simple, just call node to run ```port-vhoster.js``` optionally name an alternative config file path:\n\n```\n\n    [sudo] node port-vhoster.js [alternative-config-file.json]\n\n```\n\nYou will need super user permissions if you try the listen to (share) ports below 1024 (e.g. port 80).","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2012-12-28T21:52:36.126Z"},{"number":"0.1.1","date":"2012-12-28T22:06:03.018Z"},{"number":"0.1.2","date":"2012-12-28T22:11:07.868Z"},{"number":"0.1.3","date":"2012-12-28T22:20:14.603Z"},{"number":"0.1.4","date":"2012-12-28T22:25:03.433Z"},{"number":"0.1.5","date":"2012-12-28T22:26:15.244Z"},{"number":"0.1.6","date":"2012-12-28T22:31:01.788Z"},{"number":"0.1.7","date":"2012-12-28T22:31:22.843Z"},{"number":"0.1.8","date":"2012-12-28T22:33:31.302Z"},{"number":"0.1.9","date":"2012-12-28T22:34:28.754Z"},{"number":"0.1.10","date":"2012-12-28T22:36:55.541Z"},{"number":"0.1.11","date":"2012-12-28T22:43:17.725Z"},{"number":"0.1.12","date":"2012-12-28T22:43:32.595Z"},{"number":"0.1.13","date":"2012-12-28T22:45:04.879Z"},{"number":"0.1.14","date":"2012-12-28T23:18:59.189Z"},{"number":"0.1.15","date":"2012-12-28T23:25:04.091Z"},{"number":"0.1.16","date":"2012-12-29T13:03:37.636Z"}],"starsCount":1,"created":"2012-12-28T21:52:33.953Z","modified":"2012-12-29T13:03:37.636Z","owners":[{"name":"kyr0","email":"info@aron-homberg.de"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"port-vhoster","_rev":"1-019d0d610d658a48b35d4e449ea72fe8","author":{"name":"Aron Homberg","email":"info@aron-homberg.de"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.16"},"dist":{"shasum":"c9ac3651778d8d05a83953ce156624c7c433b88f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/port-vhoster/-/port-vhoster-0.1.16.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"kyr0","email":"info@aron-homberg.de"}],"time":{"modified":"2012-12-29T13:03:37.636Z","created":"2012-12-28T21:52:33.953Z","0.1.0":"2012-12-28T21:52:36.126Z","0.1.1":"2012-12-28T22:06:03.018Z","0.1.2":"2012-12-28T22:11:07.868Z","0.1.3":"2012-12-28T22:20:14.603Z","0.1.4":"2012-12-28T22:25:03.433Z","0.1.5":"2012-12-28T22:26:15.244Z","0.1.6":"2012-12-28T22:31:01.788Z","0.1.7":"2012-12-28T22:31:22.843Z","0.1.8":"2012-12-28T22:33:31.302Z","0.1.9":"2012-12-28T22:34:28.754Z","0.1.10":"2012-12-28T22:36:55.541Z","0.1.11":"2012-12-28T22:43:17.725Z","0.1.12":"2012-12-28T22:43:32.595Z","0.1.13":"2012-12-28T22:45:04.879Z","0.1.14":"2012-12-28T23:18:59.189Z","0.1.15":"2012-12-28T23:25:04.091Z","0.1.16":"2012-12-29T13:03:37.636Z"},"users":{"davidspriggs":true}}}
