You want to decide to which server a user connect basing on its username.\n\nThe solution with this module is to let the production server to act as a Proxy. If the user who does the request has to connect to the staging server, because its field \"server\" in the database is set to \"staging\", the production server does the request for him (with the get or post fields) and it will return the response.\n\nThe module automatically understand if the request was a GET or a POST and forward the GET or POST fields.\n\n\n### Installing NodeGetPostProxy\n\n```\nnpm install nodegetpostproxy\n```\n\n### How to use it\n\n```\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\nvar http = require('http');\nvar httpProxy = require('NodeGetPostProxy');\n\n\nvar proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer({\n  target: \"http://....\" //link of the development server\n});\n\n\napp.use(function(req,res,next){\n    if (req.params('user_name') == 'Pippo'){\n      proxy.web(req,res);\n    } else {\n      return next();\n    }\n});\n\nhttp.createServer(app).listen(80);\nconsole.log('Listening on port 80...');\n\n```\n\n### Run the example\n\nYou can find an example in the folder \"example\".\n\nIn 3 different terminal windows run:\n- node app.js\n- node app_development.js\n- node app_staging.js\n\nGo to the browser:\n\nWith the link http://localhost will response the production server\nWith the link http://localhost/?user_name=Pippo will response the development server\nWith the link http://localhost/?user_name=Mario will response the staging server\n","created":"2015-01-14T20:36:05.865Z","modified":"2015-01-16T18:45:18.005Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mikspi","email":"michelespina89@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mikspi","email":"michelespina89@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":"./","_id":"node-get-post-proxy","_npmUser":{"name":"mikspi","email":"michelespina89@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.14","_rev":"1-143c410d737fac2860e34eabef03575a","_shasum":"d4409c4d2af47a4518694a8555d97c3ced7d0188","author":{"name":"Michele Spina"},"directories":{"example":"example"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"d4409c4d2af47a4518694a8555d97c3ced7d0188","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-get-post-proxy/-/node-get-post-proxy-0.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mikspi","email":"michelespina89@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-01-16T18:45:18.005Z","created":"2015-01-14T20:36:05.865Z","0.0.0":"2015-01-14T20:36:05.865Z","0.0.1":"2015-01-14T20:45:25.091Z","0.0.2":"2015-01-16T18:45:18.005Z"}}}
