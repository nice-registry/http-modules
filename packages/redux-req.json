redux-request\n:beginner: A redux middleware for handling HTTP requests\n\nIt's based on plain old XHR, though not as fancy as fetch, it simply does the job and there's no need for extra dependencies.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jedirandy/redux-req.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jedirandy/redux-req)\n[![dependencies](https://david-dm.org/jedirandy/redux-req.svg)](https://david-dm.org/jedirandy/redux-req)\n[![npm module](https://badge.fury.io/js/redux-req.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/redux-req)\n[![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/jedirandy/redux-req/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/jedirandy/redux-req?branch=master)\n\n## Install\n```bash\nnpm install redux-req\n```\n\n## A quick example\n\n```javascript\nimport { ACTION_TYPE } from 'redux-request';\n\n// dispatch an API request\ndispatch({\n  type: ACTION_TYPE,\n  resourceName: 'users'\n  url: '/api/users',\n  method: 'GET',\n  requestType: 'REQUEST_API',\n  receiveType: 'RECEIVE_API'\n});\n\n```\nonce a request is dispatched, the middleware will dispatch an action of the specified request type, you can make a reducer to handle this action, for instance, update the loading state for the resource.\n\nwhen the request is completed, the middleware will dispatch an event of the specified receive type, similarly, a reducer can be used to handle the response, with a result of either failure or success.\n\n## Usage\nTo dispatch a request middleware aware action, the action should have the following properties:\n\n| prop | type | description |\n| -----| ---- | ----------- |\n| type | string | **required** should be the type imported (**ACTION_TYPE**) from the middleware |\n| resourceName | string | the name of the resource for which you want to send a request, this is necessary for reducers to identify the request|\n| url | string | the url of the resource |\n| method | string | the method of the request |\n| payload | any | the request payload |\n| beforeSend | function | a function passed with the XHR object, so that some extra work can be done before sending the request |\n\n## Reducer enhancer\n\nTo simplify the creation of reducer that can interpret the actions emitted by the middleware, a reducer enhancer is also delivered with the package, here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { enhanceReducer } from 'redux-req';\n\nconst enhanced = enhanceReducer(a_reducer);\n```\n\nthen the state will be injected with the following properties according to the request result.\n\n```javascript\n{\n    isFetching: boolean,\n    error: any // payload from the failed request, null if there's no error\n}\n```\n\n##
