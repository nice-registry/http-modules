Useful for testing.\n\n## Why ?\nOften times we need to run tests against our applications that spin up http servers.\nThis is easy enough locally when the used ports are known, but what about environments\nwhere multiple servers may be running?\n\nThis module allows one to gain access to an http server that will always have a\nnon conflicting port provisioned.\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst you need to call `for()` with your application.  An application is nothing\nother than a function.  At any time you can call `get()` to gain access to the\nnewly created server.\n\n````javascript\nvar noport = require('noport');\nvar app = function(req, res){};\n\nnoport.for(app);\n\nnoport.get(function(err, server, port){\n  server.address().port === port;\n});\n\nnoport.reset();//calls .close() on the current server\n````\n\n##LICENSE\n``````\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Joseph  Spencer\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
