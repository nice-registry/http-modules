Run multiple node HTTP servers (Domains, IP's) through one port.\n\nThis project implements a simple HTTP multi domain name / IP / directory HTTP reverse proxy for virtual hosting / port sharing.\nIt simply does what a reverse proxy does combined with some mod_rewrite feature support.\n\nThis project also shows the power of node.js by being implemented in less than 100 lines of code.\n\nPERFORMANCE NOTICE:\nThis code has NOT been tested in production / high load environments.\nSo be warned and evaluate it on your own before using it in production. Feedback is welcome!\n(It SHOULD be NOT LESS faster than the http-proxy module implementation.)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nMake sure:\n- node.js is installed (>= 0.8.*)\n- npm is installed\n\n## Installing\n\n```\n\n    [sudo] npm install -g bc-port-vhoster\n\n```\n\n## Configuring\n\nA valid configuration file for bc-port-vhoster is written in JSON notation as a single object that should provide\nthree key/value pairs:\n\n- description (String) = Description, printed to the terminal on startup.\n- port        (Number) = Source port (share port) to listen to (e.g. 80).\n- vhosts      (Object) = Key ($ip OR $domain/port) / value (target $ip:$port/$path)-pairs of vhost-configurations.\n\n## Configuration example\n\nThe following configuration is a simple routing example. You can add more vhosts to the config object too:\n\n```\n\n    {\n        \"description\": \"Routing with port sharing on port 80 (HTTP) for some domains and paths...\",\n        \"port\": 80,\n        \"vhosts\": {\n            \"www.aron-homberg.de\": \"127.0.0.1:8081\",\n            \"aron-homberg.de\": \"127.0.0.1:8081\",\n            \"example.com/downloads\": \"10.0.0.1:8080\",\n            \"example.com/uploads\": \"10.0.0.2:8080/master/golive/upload\"\n        }\n    }\n\n```\n\nTake a look at the [examples](https://github.com/milosbugarinovic/bc-port-vhoster/tree/master/examples) directory for more inspiration.\n\n## Running\n\nBy default, ```bc-port-vhoster``` searches for a config file called ```port-vhoster.json``` in current working directory.\nIf you want to use a different name, run ```bc-port-vhoster``` with the optional argument to name the config file:\n\n```\n\n    [sudo] bc-port-vhoster [$alternative-config-file.json]\n\n```\n\nYou may need super-user permissions if you want ```bc-port-vhoster``` to listen to a port below 1024 (e.g. port 80).\n\n## Logging and running in stand-alone mode\n\nIf you're on a Unix/Linux/Mac OS X system you can run bc-port-vhoster in server mode easily:\n\nStarting (e.g. ```start-vhoster.sh``` - don't forget to: ```chmod +x start-vhoster.sh```!):\n\n```\n    #!/bin/sh\n    echo \"Starting bc-port-vhoster...\"\n    nohup bc-port-vhoster > bc-port-vhoster.out 2> bc-port-vhoster.err < /dev/null &\n\n```\n\nStopping (e.g. ```stop-vhoster.sh``` - don't forget to: ```chmod +x stop-vhoster.sh```!):\n\n```\n    #!/bin/sh\n    echo \"Stopping bc-port-vhoster...\"\n    kill $(ps aux | grep '[p]ort-vhoster' | awk '{print $2}')\n\n```\n\nFor sure, server mode and logging may also be possible on Microsoft Windows platform but that's currently untested.","created":"2016-08-17T14:00:49.638Z","modified":"2016-08-17T14:23:12.822Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"milosbugarinovic","email":"milos.bugarinovic@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"milosbugarinovic","email":"milos.bugarinovic@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"bc-port-vhoster","_nodeVersion":"6.3.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/bc-port-vhoster-0.1.17.tgz_1471443790778_0.9419231142383069"},"_npmUser":{"name":"milosbugarinovic","email":"milos.bugarinovic@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.3","_rev":"1-ea602aeef9708861f7dd4609756173f3","_shasum":"df2c2f9c67af8e0a40a2c4d293d2d323e2d50bfd","author":{"name":"Aron Homberg","email":"info@aron-homberg.de"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kyr0/port-vhoster/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.17"},"dist":{"shasum":"df2c2f9c67af8e0a40a2c4d293d2d323e2d50bfd","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/bc-port-vhoster/-/bc-port-vhoster-0.1.17.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"milosbugarinovic","email":"milos.bugarinovic@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-08-17T14:23:12.822Z","created":"2016-08-17T14:00:49.638Z","0.1.16":"2016-08-17T14:00:49.638Z","0.1.17":"2016-08-17T14:23:12.822Z"}}}
