It allows you to limit:\n\n* the upload and download speed of requests.\n* the maximum number of concurrent outbound HTTP connections.\n\n[Contribute to Crapify on GitHub](https://github.com/bcoe/crapify)\n\n## Usage\n\n* `npm install crapify -g`\n* `crapify --port=5000 --speed=3000 --concurrency=2`, where:\n  * `port` is the port crapify should start on.\n  * `speed` is the connection speed in bytes/second.\n  * `concurrency` is the number of concurrent outbound connections allowed.\n  * `drop-frequency` how often should bytes be dropped? (`byte count` % `drop frequency`).\n\n## Examples\n\n### usage with npm\n\n`npm config set proxy http://127.0.0.1:5000`\n\n### usage with curl\n\n`curl -v --proxy http://127.0.0.1:5000 https://www.google.com`\n\n### usage with OSX\n\n1. Go to `system preferences`.\n2. Click on `Network`.\n3. Click on `Advanced`.\n4. Click on `Proxies`.\n5. Enable an `http`, and an `https` proxy, with `127.0.0.1`, and `:5000`, respectively.\n","created":"2015-01-04T04:30:00.406Z","modified":"2017-05-22T09:52:29.247Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"bcoe","email":"bencoe@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"email":"ben@npmjs.com","name":"bcoe"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"connect-limit","_nodeVersion":"0.10.26","_npmUser":{"name":"bcoe","email":"bencoe@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.1.15","_rev":"2-03ffa034a7f538def458a2215b52cbfe","_shasum":"145a6c0c8e14b09cb5d6262d484977184893e757","author":{"name":"Ben Coe","email":"ben@npmjs.com"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"145a6c0c8e14b09cb5d6262d484977184893e757","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/connect-limit/-/connect-limit-1.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"ben@npmjs.com","name":"bcoe"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-22T09:52:29.247Z","created":"2015-01-04T04:30:00.406Z","1.1.0":"2015-01-04T04:30:00.406Z"}}}
