next target\n\n- stream torrent to local file system\n- setup http server to stream local file system\n- create api using for http client get, update torrent stream state\n\n## requirements\n\nnotes: c/c++ compiler for node compile bufferutil, utf-8-validate module\n\n### for all platform\n\n- revision system control [git](https://git-scm.com/)\n- nodejs, include node package manager [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)\n- mongoose database server [mongoose-server](https://www.mongodb.org/)\n- python >= 2.5 < 3 [py](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n\n### with unix-like\n\n- gcc
