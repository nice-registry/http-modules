So, if the above build status is green\nthen `heck` is working. If it's red, it's not for sure that the issue is\nwith `heck`.\n\n\n## Unlicense\n\nThis is free and unencumbered public domain software.\nFor more information, see <http://unlicense.org/> or the accompanying\n[UNLICENSE](http://astrolet.github.com/there/UNLICENSE.html) file.\n\n","created":"2012-09-22T10:42:33.094Z","modified":"2015-09-30T14:48:04.475Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"orlin","email":"om@soundsapiens.com"},"owners":[{"name":"orlin","email":"om@soundsapiens.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"heck","_nodeVersion":"3.3.1","_npmUser":{"name":"orlin","email":"om@soundsapiens.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.3","_rev":"1-30dd46881812e79c3aa7f48c09415066","_shasum":"10914b982938564bb4256de8f75b6ce300533e8c","author":{"name":"Orlin M Bozhinov","email":"om@soundsapiens.com","url":"http://soundsapiens.com"},"bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/orlin/heck/issues"},"contributors":[],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.4-1"},"dist":{"shasum":"10914b982938564bb4256de8f75b6ce300533e8c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/heck/-/heck-0.0.4-1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"orlin","email":"om@soundsapiens.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-09-30T14:48:04.475Z","created":"2012-09-22T10:42:33.094Z","0.0.0":"2012-09-22T10:42:35.239Z","0.0.1":"2012-09-23T10:18:14.049Z","0.0.2":"2012-09-23T15:52:13.238Z","0.0.3":"2012-09-23T17:18:34.045Z","0.0.4":"2012-10-29T20:10:14.531Z","0.0.4-1":"2015-09-30T14:48:04.475Z"}}}
