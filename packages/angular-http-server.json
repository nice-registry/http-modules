Instead, run `angular-http-server` in http mode\nand forward traffic to it from an SSL-enabled reverse-proxy server (for instance, you can set one\nup with [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/reverse-proxy/))\n\nIf you're only using `angular-http-server` for development or testing, a self-signed SSL certificate\nis fine. For example, end-to-end tests with [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/) require the\nAngular application to be actively served, which can be done using a background `angular-http-server`.\nIf your end-to-end testing suite requires your application be served over HTTPS, the self-signed\ncertificate generated when you pass the `--https`/`--ssl` flag will work fine to provide that.\n\n## To develop\n\nhttp://justjs.com/posts/npm-link-developing-your-own-npm-modules-without-tears\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2015-07-26T15:46:20.968Z","modified":"2017-06-24T05:34:05.471Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"hotbelgo","email":"hotbelgo@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"hotbelgo","email":"hotbelgo@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"angular-http-server","_nodeVersion":"6.11.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/angular-http-server-1.2.0.tgz_1498282444409_0.5651181198190898"},"_npmUser":{"name":"hotbelgo","email":"hotbelgo@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"6-e014d07764b634fe62caafcaa1669d77","_shasum":"4099f2e0f95914a7c500d071223711735e6bf064","author":{"name":"Simon Hampton"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/simonh1000/angular-http-server/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Dale Myszewski","email":"dale@daleslab.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"4099f2e0f95914a7c500d071223711735e6bf064","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/angular-http-server/-/angular-http-server-1.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"hotbelgo","email":"hotbelgo@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-24T05:34:05.471Z","created":"2015-07-26T15:46:20.968Z","1.0.0":"2015-07-26T15:46:20.968Z","1.0.1":"2015-07-26T15:59:26.081Z","1.0.2":"2015-07-26T16:01:02.730Z","1.0.3":"2015-07-26T16:06:22.186Z","1.0.4":"2015-07-26T16:10:05.630Z","1.0.5":"2015-09-19T12:57:03.069Z","1.0.6":"2016-09-15T09:03:09.487Z","1.0.7":"2016-11-03T12:29:02.018Z","1.0.8":"2017-05-26T09:13:29.684Z","1.1.0":"2017-06-02T18:45:30.823Z","1.2.0":"2017-06-24T05:34:05.471Z"},"users":{"jits":true,"xieranmaya":true}}}
