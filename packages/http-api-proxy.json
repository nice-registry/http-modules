node-api-proxy\n\nA reverse proxy designed for use with rate limited APIs.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install http-api-proxy\n    \n## Usage\n\nAny requests to the proxy must have the `Host` header set to the upstream host.\nAny requests to an upstream host that the proxy has not been configured for will return errors unless a default interval is set.\n\nTo start a proxy:\n\n    http-api-proxy -c <config-file.json>\n\nIf the config file is not specified,\nit defaults to `~/.config/http-api-proxy/config.json`\n(or the appropriate value if you've set `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`).\n\nThe config file should be a JSON file with the following properties:\n\n* `httpPort`: The port on which the HTTP proxy server should listen.\n  The server on this port will only proxy sites where the protocol is HTTP.\n* `httpsPort` (optional): If set, listen on this port and proxy sites where the protocol is HTTPS.\n  Note that the proxy server itself still uses HTTP rather than HTTPS.\n* `sites`: A list of sites that the proxy can delegate requests to.\n  If a request is made for a site that is not referenced here,\n  the proxy will respond with a 500 error.\n  Each element should have the following properties:\n  * `upstream`: The host for the upstream site, such as `http://example.com` or `http://example.com:8080`.\n  * `interval`: Ensure that at least `interval` milliseconds elapse between each request to this site.\n* `cacheAge` (optional): If set, successful GET requests will be cached for `cacheAge` milliseconds.\n* `cachePath` (optional): If set, the specified path will be used to persist the cache.\n* `defaultInterval` (optional): If set, any requests to an upstream host that have not been explicitly configured will use this value for `interval`.\n\n## Examples\n\nSuppose you want to access a particular API at most once per second:\n\n    http-api-proxy -c config.json\n\nwhere config.json looks like:\n\n    {\n        \"sites\": [\n            {\n                \"upstream\": \"http://example.com\",\n                \"interval\": 1000\n            }\n        ],\n        \"httpPort\": 8080\n    }\n    \nThen, to use the proxy:\n\n    curl http://localhost:8080/ -H\"Host: example.com\"\n\nIf you wanted to also proxy a site that is served over HTTPS:\n\n    {\n        \"sites\": [\n            {\n                \"upstream\": \"http://example.com\",\n                \"interval\": 1000\n            },\n            {\n                \"upstream\": \"https://secret.example.com\",\n                \"interval\": 1000\n            }\n        ],\n        \"httpPort\": 8080,\n        \"httpsPort\": 8081\n    }\n\nAnd to use the proxy:\n\n    curl https://localhost:8081/ -H\"Host: secret.example.com\"\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2013-06-12T08:33:57.292Z","modified":"2017-04-03T17:05:17.657Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mwilliamson","email":"mike@zwobble.org"},"owners":[{"name":"mwilliamson","email":"mike@zwobble.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-api-proxy","_nodeVersion":"5.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http-api-proxy-1.0.0.tgz_1491239115678_0.041683390038087964"},"_npmUser":{"name":"mwilliamson","email":"mike@zwobble.org"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.9","_rev":"4-8c9dc977faebabd3aa335c0ea4b1f3f7","_shasum":"3d43cd2f1bb100c88cc979daa710258912e338e8","directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"3d43cd2f1bb100c88cc979daa710258912e338e8","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/http-api-proxy/-/http-api-proxy-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mwilliamson","email":"mike@zwobble.org"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-03T17:05:17.657Z","created":"2013-06-12T08:33:57.292Z","0.1.0":"2013-06-12T08:34:00.423Z","0.1.1":"2013-06-30T22:17:06.144Z","0.2.0":"2013-07-22T09:44:12.668Z","0.2.1":"2013-09-06T09:53:20.321Z","0.2.2":"2013-09-09T10:55:00.742Z","0.2.3":"2013-09-24T12:12:55.128Z","0.2.4":"2013-11-08T14:25:52.952Z","1.0.0":"2017-04-03T17:05:17.657Z"},"users":{"shakakira":true,"waawal":true}}}
