{"name":"browserver-client","version":"0.1.3","description":"෴ A node.js HTTP server in your browser ෴","main":"browserver.js","repository":"https://github.com/jed/browserver-client","license":"BSD","readme":"෴ browserver-client ෴\n========================\n\nThis is a [browserver](http://browserver.org) client, for the browser.\n\nbrowserver-client exposes the important bits of the [node.js](http://nodejs.org) [http API](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/all.html#all_http) in the browser, allowing it to receive incoming HTTP requests and make outgoing HTTP requests via WebSockets.\n\nThis library, along with [browserver-node](https://github.com/jed/browserver-node), is all the code you need to set up your own browserver.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nIn `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My Browserver App</title>\n    <script src=\"/optional/path/to/websocket-shim\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/path/to/browserver\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/app.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn `app.js`:\n\n```javascript\n// to handle incoming HTTP requests,\n// use the standard node.js http.Server API\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  if (req.method != \"GET\") {\n    res.writeHead(405, {\"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"})\n    return res.end(\"Method not allowed\")\n  }\n\n  var pathname = req.url.split(\"?\")[0]\n\n  if (pathname != \"/hello\") {\n    res.writeHead(404, {\"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"})\n    return res.end(\"Not found.\")\n  }\n\n  res.writeHead(200, {\"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"})\n  res.end(\"Hello, world!\")\n})\n\n// establish a WebSocket (or compatible) connection,\n// in this case using engine.io\nvar ws = new eio.Socket({host: \"myserver.com\"})\n\n// bind the browserver HTTP server to the WebSocket\n// and wait for connections from the browserver proxy!\nserver.listen(ws)\n\n// to make outgoing HTTP requests w/o cross-domain issues,\n// use http.get or http.request\nhttp.get(\"http://www.google.com/index.html\", function(res) {\n  console.log(\"Google answered back!\")\n})\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\nThe browserver-client API is basically a port of the node.js [http API](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/all.html#all_http), with a few caveats:\n\n- Streaming is not supported. This means a `ServerRequest` or `ClientResponse` will only emit one `data` event, and that multiple calls to the `write` method of a `ServerResponse` or `ClientRequest` will be buffered locally and sent when `end` is called. The `data` events are provided for compatibility, but aren't technically needed, since the body itself is stored on the `body` property of the `ServerRequest` or `ClientResponse`.\n\n- The aspects of the node.js implementation that don't map well to the browser (such as `writeContinue` and `addTrailers` methods, and client agents) have been omitted.\n\nOtherwise, if there is a method or behavior that differs from what you'd expect on node.js, please [file an issue](https://github.com/jed/browser-client/issues).\n\nTODO\n----\n\n- Include more client tests in the phantomjs tests run for [browserver-node](https://github.com/jed/browserver-node)\n- Make an exhaustive list of the HTTP APIs supported and not supported.\n- Consider enabling support for `addEventListener` events.\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2012-08-27T13:48:02.831Z"},{"number":"0.1.1","date":"2012-08-27T13:52:23.247Z"},{"number":"0.1.3","date":"2013-05-17T23:41:08.341Z"}],"starsCount":0,"created":"2012-08-27T13:47:59.840Z","modified":"2013-05-17T23:41:08.341Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jed","email":"tr@nslator.jp"},"owners":[{"name":"jed","email":"tr@nslator.jp"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"browserver-client","_npmUser":{"name":"jed","email":"tr@nslator.jp"},"_npmVersion":"1.2.21","_rev":"1-e1e411db406d1c172b1fe2ed4aea8c39","author":{"name":"Jed Schmidt"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jed/browserver-client/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"daf4afb517dc4f6ebb3d6c7d78c05e45af61e890","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/browserver-client/-/browserver-client-0.1.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jed","email":"tr@nslator.jp"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-05-17T23:41:08.341Z","created":"2012-08-27T13:47:59.840Z","0.1.0":"2012-08-27T13:48:02.831Z","0.1.1":"2012-08-27T13:52:23.247Z","0.1.3":"2013-05-17T23:41:08.341Z"},"users":{}}}
