Ember CLI app.\n\n<http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/>\n\n----\n\nAre you tired of\n\n- Writing one set of fixtures for your tests, and another for development?\n- Wiring up tests for each of your apps manually, from scratch?\n- Changing lots of files/tests when your API changes?\n\nEmber CLI Mirage may be for you! It lets you create a client-side server using [Pretender](https://github.com/trek/pretender) to help you develop and test your app. By default, it only runs if you're not in production and if you're not proxying to an explicit API server via `ember serve --proxy`.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nember install ember-cli-mirage  # install:addon for Ember CLI < 0.2.3\n```\n\n## Updating\n\nThis project is new and the API is subject to change. When updating your project to a newer version of Ember CLI Mirage, please consult [the changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) for any update notes.\n\n## Getting started\n\nCheck out the [Docs](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/docs/v0.3.x/)!\n\n## Support\n\nHaving trouble? Open an issue!\n\nYou can use the [Mirage Boilerplate Twiddle](https://ember-twiddle.com/eedfd390d8394d54d5bfd0ed988a5d0f) to reproduce your issue.\n\n## Contributing\n\nHave a look at our [Contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n","starsCount":8,"created":"2015-02-28T17:36:35.692Z","modified":"2017-06-20T20:34:48.006Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"samselikoff","email":"sam.selikoff@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"blimmer","email":"ben@benlimmer.com"},{"name":"cibernox","email":"miguel.camba@gmail.com"},{"name":"rwjblue","email":"me@rwjblue.com"},{"name":"samselikoff","email":"sam.selikoff@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ember-cli-mirage","_nodeVersion":"6.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/ember-cli-mirage-0.3.3.tgz_1496541256871_0.7641863985918462"},"_npmUser":{"name":"samselikoff","email":"sam.selikoff@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"19-c42bbfae8bf7764b7bdf22ef394a5a3a","_shasum":"42b8779d857859341cbb219050ea2fec4d72ea88","author":{"name":"Sam Selikoff"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage/issues"},"directories":{"doc":"doc","test":"tests"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.3","beta":"0.3.0-beta.5"},"dist":{"shasum":"42b8779d857859341cbb219050ea2fec4d72ea88","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/ember-cli-mirage/-/ember-cli-mirage-0.3.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"blimmer","email":"ben@benlimmer.com"},{"name":"cibernox","email":"miguel.camba@gmail.com"},{"name":"rwjblue","email":"me@rwjblue.com"},{"name":"samselikoff","email":"sam.selikoff@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-20T20:34:48.006Z","created":"2015-02-28T17:36:35.692Z","0.0.19":"2015-02-28T17:36:35.692Z","0.0.21":"2015-03-04T02:18:28.492Z","0.0.22":"2015-03-08T21:38:00.014Z","0.0.23":"2015-03-14T03:03:52.487Z","0.0.24":"2015-04-02T13:04:35.725Z","0.0.25":"2015-04-17T18:44:59.128Z","0.0.26":"2015-04-17T19:40:17.668Z","0.0.27":"2015-04-25T02:34:15.296Z","0.0.28":"2015-05-16T22:31:01.212Z","0.0.29":"2015-05-20T20:17:14.424Z","0.1.0":"2015-06-01T12:35:39.666Z","0.1.1":"2015-06-01T14:40:42.793Z","0.1.2":"2015-06-01T22:26:02.998Z","0.1.3":"2015-06-10T15:55:05.852Z","0.1.4":"2015-06-10T16:12:19.819Z","0.1.5":"2015-06-22T19:56:51.176Z","0.1.6":"2015-07-27T11:51:02.216Z","0.1.7":"2015-08-17T15:07:26.781Z","0.1.8":"2015-08-18T02:12:49.656Z","0.1.9":"2015-10-05T12:03:33.129Z","0.1.10":"2015-10-13T18:25:14.596Z","0.1.11":"2015-10-14T12:06:44.384Z","0.2.0-beta.1":"2015-11-07T18:54:11.737Z","0.2.0-beta.2":"2016-01-15T23:09:36.219Z","0.2.0-beta.3":"2016-01-16T22:54:25.847Z","0.2.0-beta.4":"2016-02-09T04:57:20.215Z","0.2.0-beta.5":"2016-02-19T02:51:51.722Z","0.2.0-beta.6":"2016-02-24T21:10:38.856Z","0.2.0-beta.7":"2016-02-25T14:35:59.253Z","0.2.0-beta.8":"2016-03-24T16:09:07.951Z","0.1.12":"2016-03-29T18:28:40.806Z","0.1.13":"2016-03-30T07:24:19.520Z","0.2.0-beta.9":"2016-05-13T16:26:15.918Z","0.2.0":"2016-05-31T14:42:24.348Z","0.2.1":"2016-06-22T20:16:33.570Z","0.2.2":"2016-09-19T16:12:07.728Z","0.1.14":"2016-09-27T14:59:38.299Z","0.2.3":"2016-10-20T19:31:28.651Z","0.2.4":"2016-11-07T04:42:13.023Z","0.3.0-beta.1":"2016-12-22T17:32:16.865Z","0.3.0-beta.2":"2016-12-22T20:29:57.205Z","0.3.0-beta.3":"2016-12-30T20:02:46.249Z","0.3.0-beta.4":"2017-01-02T17:17:40.309Z","0.2.5":"2017-01-25T21:08:09.694Z","0.3.0-beta.5":"2017-01-29T04:08:58.427Z","0.2.6":"2017-02-21T17:10:00.973Z","0.2.7":"2017-03-09T04:16:15.569Z","0.2.8":"2017-03-11T09:51:17.546Z","0.2.9":"2017-03-20T20:27:21.846Z","0.3.0":"2017-03-21T05:35:57.972Z","0.3.1":"2017-03-23T17:12:39.189Z","0.3.2":"2017-05-25T06:24:10.944Z","0.3.3":"2017-06-04T01:54:18.991Z"},"users":{"gregone":true,"mswanson1524":true,"neilor":true,"darrylr":true,"bmeurant":true,"eturino":true,"equimper":true,"rick1125":true}}}
