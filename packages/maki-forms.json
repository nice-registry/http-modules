A form will be auto-generated with the correct verb (or a verb-hack, see \"middleware\") and all associated validators.\n\n### Middleware\nThe majority of browsers only support GET and POST forms.  To solve this problem, maki-forms injects non-supported verbs in a hidden input, named `method`.  A server-side middleware looks for this field in POST requests and subsequently interprets the request as the correct verb.\n","created":"2014-09-14T20:55:27.035Z","modified":"2015-01-30T04:56:31.597Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"martindale","email":"eric@ericmartindale.com"},"owners":[{"name":"martindale","email":"eric@ericmartindale.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"maki-forms","_nodeVersion":"0.10.35","_npmUser":{"name":"martindale","email":"eric@ericmartindale.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.1.17","_rev":"1-5bf27220c68a5f3dd0413e5539821d35","_shasum":"4f730ded67679eb5e574229515f94b6c325d13b9","author":{"name":"Eric Martindale"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"4f730ded67679eb5e574229515f94b6c325d13b9","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/maki-forms/-/maki-forms-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"martindale","email":"eric@ericmartindale.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-01-30T04:56:31.597Z","created":"2014-09-14T20:55:27.035Z","0.0.0":"2014-09-14T20:55:27.035Z","0.0.1":"2015-01-30T04:56:31.597Z"}}}
