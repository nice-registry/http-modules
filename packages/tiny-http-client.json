Therefore,\nall [options][1] supported by HTTP's request are supported. However, to simplify verbosity,\nyou can pass an initial set of options to the `TinyHttpClient` constructor and they will be\napplied on any request made using this object.\n\n### Initialization\n\n    const httpClient = new TinyHttpClient({\n      protocol: 'https:',                 // set the default protocol\n      hostname: 'api.github.com',         // set the default host\n       headers: {                         // set the default request headers\n        'Accept': 'application/json'\n      }\n    });\n\n### GET\n\nHTTP GET requests will internally buffer the body and return it once the promise resolves.\n\n    client.get({path: '/users/foo4u'})\n    .then(JSON.parse)\n    .then((response) => {\n      console.log(response.body);\n    });\n    .catch((err) => {\n      console.log(err);\n    });\n\n### HEAD\n\nHTTP HEAD requests will return a promise resolving response headers if the request is successful.\n\n    client.head({path: '/users/foo4u'})\n    .then((headers) => {\n      console.log(headers);\n    });\n    .catch((err) => {\n      console.log(err);\n    });\n\n## Contributing\n\nFound a bug or want add a feature?
