The idea is, instead of connecting your\nclients-under-test to the real server, you connect them to RoboHydra\nand make RoboHydra respond with whatever you need for each request.\nYou can test many different kinds of clients, like Javascript-heavy\nweb application front-ends, desktop GUI applications that connect to\nHTTP-based APIs (eg. the Flickr API), mobile applications that contact\na server to login, etc. It helps answer questions like \"how would the\nclient behave when it receives a certain response from the server?\",\n\"does the client send the correct request to the server when certain\naction is performed?\", \"what would happen if this request takes more\nthan normal to process\", or \"what would happen if this request gets\nits response before this other request?\". See examples of\n[use-cases](http://robohydra.org/usecases/) on the website.\n\nA RoboHydra is composed of \"heads\", pieces of code that listen in a\ngiven path and trigger a certain behaviour when a request for that\npath is received. The behaviour can be: checking the incoming request,\nreturning a static response, serving a file from the file system,\nproxy the request to another server, store certain data and return a\ncanned response, etc. All these different behaviours can be combined\nin powerful ways to achieve the results you need.\n\nRoboHydra is written in Javascript, runs under Node and is distributed\nunder the Apache 2.0 license.
