The\nserver is file-based, and for directories given as URLs, the server will return\nthe DEFAULT_FILE (\"index.html\", see \"lib/Constants\"). If there is no default\nfile, the server returns 404 for both HEAD and GET.\n\n## SSI supported directives\n- \"include\" -> basic implementation with only one attribute named \"file\";\nno \"/\" at start or \"..\" are allowed\n- \"exec\" -> supports both \"cgi\" and \"cmd\" attributes; if both arguments\nare supplied, only \"cgi\" is taken into consideration; \"cgi\" scripts MUST\nbe executable\n- \"printenv\" -> prints environmental variables; no attributes\n- SSI directives are case sensitive, and they should have the exact syntax\ndefined at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/ssi.html\n\n## Implementation\nThe server is based on Factory Pattern in order to make it easy to add or\nchange implementations of HTTP method requests or SSI directives. SSI\ndirectives are processed using asynchronous callback functions and a sort of\nrecursion. More exactly, the function SsiProcessor.processContentHelper()\nprocesses the file content by searching for SSI directives. If any is found,\nit processes the directive and executes a callback (the callback is needed\nbecause of asynchronous callbacks to the file system). The callback will call\nagain SsiProcessor.processContentHelper() until all file content is processed.\n\n## NPM modules\n- \"argchecker\" -> used to process command line arguments, like PORT and PATH\n- \"winston\" -> logger on node.js\n- \"mocha\" -> testing framework\n\n## Installation / Uninstallation:\n- npm install [--dev] [-g] ssihttpserver\n- npm uninstall [--dev] [-g] ssihttpserver\n- [-g] is for global\n- [--dev] is needed for dev modules; if this option doesn't work, then\n\"npm install ssihttpserver\" and \"npm install -g mocha\"\n\n## Run:\n- locally: INSTALL_DIR/node_modules/.bin/httpServer [--port PORT] [--path PATH]\n- globally: httpServer [--port PORT] [--path PATH]\n- PORT and PATH are optionally\n- default PORT is 8080 and default PATH is APP_DIR/serverRoot\n- nodejs / node are needed to run the program successful (nodejs for the httpServer,\nand node for mocha)\n\n## Usage:\n```js\nvar HttpServer = require('ssihttpserver');\n\n// HttpServer arguments are optional\nvar httpServer = new HttpServer({\n\tport: [PORT],\n\tpath: [PATH]\n});\n\n// Start server\nhttpServer.start();\n\n...\n\n// Close server\nhttpServer.close();\n```\n\n## Testing\n- uses \"mocha\" library; MUST be in the application root directory when running\n\"mocha\"; any other directory will not work\n- tests are full stack; they represent clients that connect to the server and\nsend different HTTP requests\n- some tests will work only on UNIX Operating Systems, like the \"exec\" tests;\nit uses the \"ls\" command, not \"dir\"; if on Windows, use \"cygwin\";\n\"testRoot/ssi/script.cgi\" SHOULD be executable for successful run of tests\n- if detailed information about the server is needed, the next line should be\ncommented in \"test/test.js\":\n```js\nwinston.remove(winston.transports.Console);\n```\n- for manual testing, add more files to \"serverRoot\" or change the DEFAULT_PATH\nto \"testRoot\" and use a browser\n- \"testRoot/ssi/execCgi.shtml.expected\" test is taken from\nhttp://help.cs.umn.edu/web/cgi-tutorial\n\n## Documentation\n- http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt\n- https://github.com/tasogarepg/argchecker\n- https://github.com/flatiron/winston/\n- http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/\n- http://nodejs.org/api/http.html\n- http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/util.html\n- http://decodize.com/javascript/build-nodejs-npm-installation-package-scratch/\n- http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html\n- http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/ssi.htmls\n- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes\n- http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/webmaster/article.php/3473341\n\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2014-01-27T06:54:37.926Z","modified":"2014-02-02T15:54:16.666Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"cmihail","email":"mihail.costea90@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"cmihail","email":"mihail.costea90@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ssihttpserver","_npmUser":{"name":"cmihail","email":"mihail.costea90@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.24","_rev":"1-a34c4460378f52958325cd77efa1c030","author":{"name":"Mihail Costea"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/cmihail/HttpServerWithSSI/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"cca6260c184015a52793aadea05c0f319a395bf6","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ssihttpserver/-/ssihttpserver-0.2.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cmihail","email":"mihail.costea90@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-02-02T15:54:16.666Z","created":"2014-01-27T06:54:37.926Z","0.1.0":"2014-01-27T06:54:37.926Z","0.1.1":"2014-01-27T18:08:08.089Z","0.1.2":"2014-01-27T18:10:40.376Z","0.1.3":"2014-02-02T15:13:42.524Z","0.2.0":"2014-02-02T15:47:14.968Z","0.2.1":"2014-02-02T15:54:16.666Z"},"users":{"wonno":true}}}
