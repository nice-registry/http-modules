View the [docs](http://visionmedia.github.com/superagent/).\n\n**FORK** this fork removes the suck introduced into superagent 1.x by returning the `end` api back to being compliant with node-style callback conventions as in the original superagent 0.x design. This fork will track official releases of superagent so everyone can benefit from improvements in superagent. The goal is merge this fork back into superagent and to retire this fork.\n\n![super agent](http://f.cl.ly/items/3d282n3A0h0Z0K2w0q2a/Screenshot.png)\n\n## Installation\n\nnode:\n\n```\n$ npm install superagent-ls\n```\n\ncomponent:\n\n```\n$ component install kmalakoff/superagent-ls\n```\n\nWorks with [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) and should work with [webpack](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/wiki/Superagent-for-Webpack)\n\n```js\nrequest\n  .post('/api/pet')\n  .send({ name: 'Manny', species: 'cat' })\n  .set('X-API-Key', 'foobar')\n  .set('Accept', 'application/json')\n  .end(function(err, res){\n    // Calling the end function will send the request\n  });\n```\n\n## Supported browsers\n\nTested browsers:\n\n- Latest Android\n- Latest Firefox\n- Latest Chrome\n- IE9 through latest\n- Latest iPhone\n- Latest Safari\n\nEven though IE9 is supported, a polyfill `window.btoa` is needed to use basic auth.\n\n# Plugins\n\nSuperagent is easily extended via plugins.\n\n```js\nvar nocache = require('superagent-no-cache');\nvar request = require('superagent-ls');\nvar prefix = require('superagent-prefix')('/static');\n\nrequest\n.get('/some-url')\n.use(prefix) // Prefixes *only* this request\n.use(nocache) // Prevents caching of *only* this request\n.end(function(err, res){\n    // Do something\n});\n```\n\nExisting plugins:\n * [superagent-no-cache](https://github.com/johntron/superagent-no-cache) - prevents caching by including Cache-Control header\n * [superagent-prefix](https://github.com/johntron/superagent-prefix) - prefixes absolute URLs (useful in test environment)\n * [superagent-mock](https://github.com/M6Web/superagent-mock) - simulate HTTP calls by returning data fixtures based on the requested URL\n * [superagent-mocker](https://github.com/rambler-digital-solutions/superagent-mocker) â€” simulate REST API\n * [superagent-cache](https://github.com/jpodwys/superagent-cache) - superagent with built-in, flexible caching\n\nPlease prefix your plugin with `superagent-*` so that it can easily be found by others.\n\nFor superagent extensions such as couchdb and oauth visit the [wiki](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/wiki).\n\n## Running node tests\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```shell\n$ npm install\n```\nRun em!\n\n```shell\n$ make test\n```\n\n## Running browser tests\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```shell\n$ npm install\n```\n\nStart the test runner:\n\n```shell\n$ make test-browser-local\n```\n\nVisit `http://localhost:4000/__zuul` in your browser.\n\nEdit tests and refresh your browser. You do not have to restart the test runner.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","created":"2015-03-20T19:10:36.339Z","modified":"2015-11-24T18:42:07.071Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"kmalakoff","email":"kmalakoff@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"kmalakoff","email":"kmalakoff@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"superagent-ls","_nodeVersion":"4.2.2","_npmUser":{"name":"kmalakoff","email":"kmalakoff@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.7","_rev":"1-6ab7913ba66bbb411cd5e8b6af500fdf","_shasum":"d167c1d61343e268f903723ec0c60e89d74b2d27","author":{"name":"TJ Holowaychuk","email":"tj@vision-media.ca"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kmalakoff/superagent-ls/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Hunter Loftis","email":"hunter@hunterloftis.com"},{"name":"Kevin Malakoff","email":"kmalakoff@gmail.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.4.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"d167c1d61343e268f903723ec0c60e89d74b2d27","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/superagent-ls/-/superagent-ls-1.4.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"kmalakoff","email":"kmalakoff@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"Readme.md","time":{"modified":"2015-11-24T18:42:07.071Z","created":"2015-03-20T19:10:36.339Z","0.0.0":"2015-03-20T19:10:36.339Z","1.1.0":"2015-03-21T16:54:33.176Z","1.2.0":"2015-04-25T18:46:45.414Z","1.3.0":"2015-09-08T04:58:36.812Z","1.4.0":"2015-11-24T18:42:07.071Z"}}}
