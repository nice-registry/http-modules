Why would you want to do this? By reducing concurrent duplicate requests you only need to process a small fraction of them which means processing time can be spent elsewhere.\n\n***Note: cookies are also collapsed so do not use for authenticated requests which require unique tokens per request.***\n\n## usage\n\n```\nvar httpCollapse = require('http-collapse'),\n    express      = require('express'),\n    app          = express();\n\napp.use(httpCollapse({ timeout: 5e3 }));\n```\n> Example usage of http-collapse\n\n### timeout\n\nIt is possible to specify a timeout whereby if a request has not finished all queued requests will timeout in addition to the original.\n\n## Testing\n\nMocha is used for testing and a `mocha.opts` file is located in `./test`.\n\n```bash\n> npm test\n```\n> Running tests\n\n## Coverage\n\nCode coverage analysis is also available.\n\n```bash\n> npm run cover\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using `npm test`\n\n## Release History\n\n- **1.4.0** Initial public release\n","versions":[{"number":"1.0.0","date":"2015-11-20T00:55:22.705Z"},{"number":"1.1.1","date":"2015-11-20T02:24:19.142Z"},{"number":"1.2.0","date":"2015-11-25T06:20:10.017Z"},{"number":"1.3.0","date":"2015-11-25T06:23:03.061Z"},{"number":"1.4.0","date":"2015-11-25T06:26:28.253Z"}],"created":"2015-11-20T00:55:22.705Z","modified":"2015-11-26T14:31:59.160Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"newscorpaus","email":"engineering@news.com.au"},"owners":[{"name":"indieisaconcept","email":"me@indieisaconcept.com"},{"name":"newscorpaus","email":"engineering@news.com.au"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-collapse","_nodeVersion":"0.10.38","_npmUser":{"name":"newscorpaus","email":"engineering@news.com.au"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.12","_rev":"1-c1922c068d0710df8f9b91ca51b95dc6","_shasum":"b56d3e32ba42d34de08c6e519d8652eb0e5708a8","author":{"name":"Jonathan Barnett","email":"jonathan.barnett@news.com.au"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/newscorpaus/http-collapse/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.4.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"b56d3e32ba42d34de08c6e519d8652eb0e5708a8","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-collapse/-/http-collapse-1.4.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"indieisaconcept","email":"me@indieisaconcept.com"},{"name":"newscorpaus","email":"engineering@news.com.au"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-11-26T14:31:59.160Z","created":"2015-11-20T00:55:22.705Z","1.0.0":"2015-11-20T00:55:22.705Z","1.1.1":"2015-11-20T02:24:19.142Z","1.2.0":"2015-11-25T06:20:10.017Z","1.3.0":"2015-11-25T06:23:03.061Z","1.4.0":"2015-11-25T06:26:28.253Z"}}}
