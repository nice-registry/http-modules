Clone this repo into your node_modules directory\n2. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`\n3. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-httpserver` and add the `.xcodeproj` file\n4. In the XCode project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNHTTPServer.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`\n5. Click `RNHTTPServer.xcodeproj` in the project navigator, go to the `Build Settings` tab and make sure  `Header Search Paths` contains both `$(SRCROOT)/../../react-native/React` and `$(SRCROOT)/../../../React` - mark both as `recursive`.\n6. Create a folder called `www` in your project's top-level directory (usually next to your node_modules and index.js file), and put the files you want to access over http in there.  \n7. Add the `www` folder to Xcode (so it gets bundled with the app).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nAll you need is to `require` the `react-native-httpserver` module and then call the `start` method, with a port.\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('react-native-httpserver');\nhttp.start(\"8999\");\n```\n\nThe toplevel URL then becomes `http://127.0.0.1:8999/index.html`, also accessible as `http.url()`.\n\n## Implementation\n\nBased on [MongooseDaemon](https://github.com/face/MongooseDaemon) and the [mongoose server](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose)\n\nMongoose is cross platform, so an Android version *should* be possible.\n\n## Changelog\n\n0.0.7\tAdded example project\n0.0.6\tAdded doc root option\n0.0.3\tPublished to npm  \n0.0.2\tReplaced GCDWebServer with Mongoose  \n0.0.1\tIPR\n\n## TODO\n\n- [x] Example project  \n- [ ] Android version  \n- [ ] Better docs  \n\n\n","created":"2015-11-17T09:25:31.715Z","modified":"2016-11-19T09:41:10.017Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"baseio","email":"js@base.io"},"owners":[{"name":"baseio","email":"js@base.io"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"react-native-httpserver","_nodeVersion":"4.2.2","_npmUser":{"name":"baseio","email":"js@base.io"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.7","_rev":"3-1e191ab10fa44a76668412a493aced89","_shasum":"6afe79a49fad453905ed183d320f0131df695f35","author":{"name":"Jorgen Skogmo","email":"js@base.io","url":"http://base.io"},"bugs":{"url":"https://gitlab.com/base.io/react-native-httpserver/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.7"},"dist":{"shasum":"6afe79a49fad453905ed183d320f0131df695f35","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/react-native-httpserver/-/react-native-httpserver-0.0.7.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"baseio","email":"js@base.io"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-11-19T09:41:10.017Z","created":"2015-11-17T09:25:31.715Z","0.0.5":"2015-11-17T09:25:31.715Z","0.0.6":"2015-11-17T10:13:06.649Z","0.0.7":"2015-11-18T08:01:37.583Z"}}}
