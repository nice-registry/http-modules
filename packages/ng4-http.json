The interceptors leverage the promise APIs to fulfill this need for both synchronous and asynchronous pre-processing.\n> There are two kinds of interceptors (and two kinds of rejection interceptors):\n> * **request**: interceptors get called with a http config object. The function is free to modify the config object or create a new one. The function needs to return the config object directly, or a promise containing the config or a new config object.\n> * **requestError**: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or resolved with a rejection.\n> * **response**: interceptors get called with http response object. The function is free to modify the response object or create a new one. The function needs to return the  response object directly, or as a promise containing the response or a new response object.\n> * **responseError**: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or resolved with a rejection.\n\n#### Usage\n\n1. Import ```Interceptor``` interface from the package and create and provide your own Interceptor, e.g.:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Interceptor } from 'ng4-http';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class CustomInterceptor implements Interceptor {\n\n  public request({ url, options }: RequestInterceptorOptions): RequestInterceptorOptions {\n    const urlString = url instanceof Request ? (<Request>url).url : url;\n\n    console.log('Request:', urlString);\n\n    return { url, options };\n  }\n\n  public responseError({ url, options, response }: ResponseInterceptorOptions): RequestInterceptorOptions {\n    const urlString = url instanceof Request ? (<Request>url).url : url;\n    console.log('Response:', urlString);\n\n    return { url, options, response };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Register your custom interceptor by injecting ```InterceptorStore``` into your module, e.g.:\n\n```typescript\nimport { InterceptorStore } from 'ng4-http';\n\n@NgModule({\n  providers: [ CustomInterceptor ]\n})\nexport class AuthModule {\n  constructor(interceptorStore: InterceptorStore, customInterceptor: CustomInterceptor) {\n    interceptorStore.register(customInterceptor);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Use ```HttpModule``` and ```Http``` service from the package instead of native ones, e.g.:\n\n```typescript\nimport { HttpModule } from 'ng4-http';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [ HttpModule ]\n})\nexport class AuthModule {}\n```","created":"2017-03-09T11:24:45.484Z","modified":"2017-03-09T20:52:45.898Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"serhiisol","email":"sergeysolonko@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"serhiisol","email":"sergeysolonko@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ng4-http","_nodeVersion":"7.7.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/ng4-http-1.0.3.tgz_1489092764043_0.8071098676882684"},"_npmUser":{"name":"serhiisol","email":"sergeysolonko@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.1.1","_rev":"4-259c5584ed0110b4a07ed962bb354dd0","_shasum":"25797423840816c4abde150bfcf0c6c3dacd6d9d","author":{"name":"Serhii Sol"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/serhiisol/ng4-http/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"25797423840816c4abde150bfcf0c6c3dacd6d9d","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/ng4-http/-/ng4-http-1.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"serhiisol","email":"sergeysolonko@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-09T20:52:45.898Z","created":"2017-03-09T11:24:45.484Z","1.0.0":"2017-03-09T11:24:45.484Z","1.0.1":"2017-03-09T19:23:53.763Z","1.0.2":"2017-03-09T20:00:11.062Z","1.0.3":"2017-03-09T20:52:45.898Z"}}}
