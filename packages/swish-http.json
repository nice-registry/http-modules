If used from AMD or CommonJS it will define a module, e.g.\n\n```javascript\nvar SwishHttp = require('swish-http/client');\n```\n\nTo set up a store, provide the URL endpoint:\n\n```javascript\nvar store = new SwishHttp('/json/my-store');\n```\n\n## On the server\n\nThe main module (`index.js`) provides the counterpart for the server.  You construct the a wrapper using an existing Swish store:\n\n```javascript\nvar wrapper = require('swish-http')(store);\n```\n\nYou can then register this as an Express middleware at the appropriate location:\n\n```javascript\napp.use('/json/my-store', wrapper.express());\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nThe tests run in the browser.  There is an Express-based test server in `test/index.js` which serves a single page (on some available port) and some JavaScript files.\n\nThe test page/server creates a fresh store for each test, and has no cleanup, so the test server should not run indefinitely.\n\nYou can start this server using `npm run test-server`.\n\nIf you append the fragment `#stopOnFirst` to the page, it will halt at the first failed test, instead of continuing testing.\n","created":"2015-06-13T15:50:04.674Z","modified":"2015-10-21T00:41:37.001Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"geraintluff","email":"luffgd@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"geraintluff","email":"luffgd@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"swish-http","_nodeVersion":"0.12.4","_npmUser":{"name":"geraintluff","email":"luffgd@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.10.1","_rev":"1-4e29404b0a9bcb6e349dd2abe0a35f71","_shasum":"ed8b66dc825f4df13eabf5468c7291c0a456e38d","author":{"name":"Geraint Luff"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"ed8b66dc825f4df13eabf5468c7291c0a456e38d","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/swish-http/-/swish-http-0.3.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"geraintluff","email":"luffgd@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-10-21T00:41:37.001Z","created":"2015-06-13T15:50:04.674Z","0.2.0":"2015-06-13T15:50:04.674Z","0.3.0":"2015-10-17T01:10:44.231Z","0.3.1":"2015-10-20T15:50:31.497Z","0.3.2":"2015-10-20T15:58:54.080Z","0.3.3":"2015-10-21T00:41:37.001Z"}}}
