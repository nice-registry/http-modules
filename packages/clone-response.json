However, you can consume a stream multiple times in the same tick, therefore allowing you to create multiple clones. e.g:\n\n```js\nconst clone1 = cloneResponse(response);\nconst clone2 = cloneResponse(response);\n// response can still be consumed in this tick but cannot be consumed if passed\n// into any async callbacks. clone1 and clone2 can be passed around and be\n// consumed in the future.\n```\n\n## API\n\n### cloneResponse(response)\n\nReturns a clone of the passed in response.\n\n#### response\n\nType: `stream`\n\nA [Node.js HTTP response stream](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) to clone.\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© Luke Childs\n","created":"2017-06-01T10:33:32.704Z","modified":"2017-06-16T12:11:29.393Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"lukechilds","email":"lukechilds123@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"lukechilds","email":"lukechilds123@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"clone-response","_nodeVersion":"8.0.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/clone-response-1.0.0.tgz_1497615089253_0.2357099496293813"},"_npmUser":{"name":"lukechilds","email":"lukechilds123@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.3","_rev":"7-156f2e7c0394bb160f85c25f60c37626","author":{"name":"Luke Childs","email":"lukechilds123@gmail.com","url":"http://lukechilds.co.uk"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/lukechilds/clone-response/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-dIA1J7HryFHdlfo7GJ+2wypKWKYOvLEU7oNLOZPoBc4qIM0tdJ0B0aZv6LWNd48ehlSN6ZsByGdXqwIX/jwuuA==","shasum":"098632e140f04cdca509c6926c7ad3a8c44f36a6","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/clone-response/-/clone-response-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"lukechilds","email":"lukechilds123@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-16T12:11:29.393Z","created":"2017-06-01T10:33:32.704Z","0.0.0":"2017-06-01T10:33:32.704Z","0.1.0":"2017-06-02T08:04:30.901Z","0.1.1":"2017-06-02T08:09:53.625Z","0.2.0":"2017-06-02T08:29:13.105Z","0.2.1":"2017-06-03T03:28:21.554Z","0.2.2":"2017-06-03T05:34:40.172Z","1.0.0":"2017-06-16T12:11:29.393Z"}}}
