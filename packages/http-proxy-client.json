However, if you are using some third party moudles, such as oauth, which internally uses http or https, then you are out of luck.\n\nNow, I have make a simple httpproxy and httpsproxy that solved this problem.\n\nAnd it is extremly simple to use: simply require the httpproxy module BEFORE loading your main server and it will pick up the httpproxy settings from environment variable\n\n## Install\n\n\t$ npm install http-proxy-client\n\tor get it from the github\n\t\t\n## Usage & Examples\n\n\tset http_proxy=http://localhost:8087\n\tnode requialall.js httpproxy.js testhttp.js\n\t\t\n## How it works\n\t\t\n\tby hookapi of the http module, http and https module NOW transparently support http_proxy environment variable without any change.\n\n## LICENSE\n\tMIT\n\t\n## TODO\n\t* support other opertations such as POST/PUT/DELETE\n\t* better coverage for https\n\n\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2013-09-14T06:15:22.203Z"}],"created":"2013-09-14T06:15:15.508Z","modified":"2013-09-14T06:15:22.203Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"softguy","email":"softguyus@yahoo.com"},"owners":[{"name":"softguy","email":"softguyus@yahoo.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-proxy-client","_npmUser":{"name":"softguy","email":"softguyus@yahoo.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.5","_rev":"1-408bb74bb0cb42055496f4b8721ee9e0","author":{"name":"softguy","email":"softguyus@yahoo.com"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"ec2e4ec46cc231d3b007aa38bbaa88c11b23228c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-proxy-client/-/http-proxy-client-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"softguy","email":"softguyus@yahoo.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-09-14T06:15:22.203Z","created":"2013-09-14T06:15:15.508Z","0.1.0":"2013-09-14T06:15:22.203Z"}}}
