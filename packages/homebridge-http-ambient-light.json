I would suggest getting an ESP8266 or an Arduino with an Ethernet shield as well as a light sensor that is compatible with those like the BH1750 for instance.\n\n## Installation\n\nRun the following command\n```\nnpm install -g homebridge-http-ambient-light\n```\n\nChances are you are going to need sudo with that.\n\n## Config.json\n\nThis is an example configuration\n\n```\n\"accessories\" : [\n    \n    {\n        \"accessory\": \"http-ambient-light\",\n        \"name\": \"Outdoor Light Sensor\",\n        \"getUrl\": \"http://192.168.2.86:22222/bh1750\",\n        \"serial\" : \"CA2B60B4213E\",\n        \"updateInterval\" : 15\n    }\n]    \n```\n\n| Key           | Description                                                                        |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| accessory     | Required. Has to be \"http-ambient-light\"                                             |\n| name          | Required. The name of this accessory. This will appear in your homekit app         |\n| getUrl         | Required. The url from where this plugin will try to update its data. |\n| serial         | Optional. Assigns a serial number. Not really required but I would advise in making up some arbitrary string. |\n| updateInterval | Optional. If you set a number here, the plugin will periodically fetch data from the URL. The value is in minutes. |\n\n## Format of the data source\n\nThis plugin expects a JSON formatted output when fetching data like this example shows\n```\n { \"light\": 0 }\n```\nThe value is expected to be an integer.\n","created":"2017-03-09T21:29:17.663Z","modified":"2017-03-09T21:29:17.663Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"lucabecker","email":"luca.becker@me.com"},"owners":[{"name":"lucabecker","email":"luca.becker@me.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"homebridge-http-ambient-light","_nodeVersion":"6.3.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/homebridge-http-ambient-light-1.0.0.tgz_1489094955725_0.8810941628180444"},"_npmUser":{"name":"lucabecker","email":"luca.becker@me.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.3","_rev":"1-20b1130bf77511186de8ebb9ea372122","_shasum":"ac929fa0ad7b1c837cb5fc9bef2b988c4cf0eaeb","author":{"name":"Luca Becker","email":"luca.becker@me.com","url":"https://github.com/lucavb"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/lucavb/homebridge-http-ambient-light/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"ac929fa0ad7b1c837cb5fc9bef2b988c4cf0eaeb","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/homebridge-http-ambient-light/-/homebridge-http-ambient-light-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"lucabecker","email":"luca.becker@me.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-09T21:29:17.663Z","created":"2017-03-09T21:29:17.663Z","1.0.0":"2017-03-09T21:29:17.663Z"}}}
