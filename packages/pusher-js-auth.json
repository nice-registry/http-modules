This plugin enables you to process multiple channel authentications within one request.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis is a plugin for the official [Pusher](http://pusher.com) JavaScript library and compatible with the latest 3.1.x release. Make sure you have a working implementation up and running.\n\n**Notice:** This version is not compatibile with Pusher 3.0 and older. Please use version [1.2.0](https://github.com/dirkbonhomme/pusher-js-auth/releases) of this plugin with older Pusher versions.\n\nDocumentation and configuration options are explained at the [Pusher-js Github page](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js)\n\n## Usage\n\nLoad the plugin after including the Pusher library\n\n    <script src=\"//js.pusher.com/3.0/pusher.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"lib/pusher-auth.js\"></script>\n\nThis plugin is also available on npm and bower:\n\n    npm install pusher-js-auth\n    bower install pusher-js-auth\n\n## Configuration\n\nThis plugin comes with a few extra configuration parameters. The whole list is available at the [Pusher-js Github page](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js#configuration)\n\n    var pusher = new Pusher(API_KEY, {\n        authTransport: 'buffered',\n        authDelay: 200\n    });\n\n### `authTransport` (String)\n\nRequired field. Use \"buffered\" to enable this plugin.\n\n### `authDelay` (Number)\n\nOptional, defaults to 0. Delay in milliseconds before executing an authentication request. The value can be as low as 0 when subcribing to multiple channels within the same event loop. Please note that the first authentication request is postponed anyway until the connection to Pusher succeeds.\n\n## Server side authentication\n\nYour authentication endpoint should be able to handle batched requests.\n\n### Incoming post data\n\n    socket_id   \t  00000.0000000\n    channel_name[0]\t  private-a\n    channel_name[1]\t  private-b\n\n### Expected output\n\n    {\n        \"private-a\": {\n            \"status\": 200, // HTTP status codes, optional on success\n            \"data\": {\n                \"auth\": \"xxxxxx:xxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"private-b\": {\n            \"status\": 200,\n            \"data\": {\n                \"auth\": \"xxxxxx:xxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"private-c\": {\n            \"status\": 403\n        }\n    }\n    \nUse one of the [server libraries](http://pusher.com/docs/libraries) to do most of the hard work.\n\n## Example implementation\n\nCopy `app_key.example.js` and `app_key.example.php` to `app_key.example.xx` and fill in your own Pusher data. Create a small PHP server and run index.html with your browser's debug console active.","created":"2016-02-16T20:15:15.688Z","modified":"2016-05-17T10:05:58.315Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"dirkbonhomme","email":"dirk@bytelogic.be"},"owners":[{"name":"dirkbonhomme","email":"dirk@bytelogic.be"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"pusher-js-auth","_nodeVersion":"5.6.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/pusher-js-auth-2.0.0.tgz_1463479555947_0.37154086004011333"},"_npmUser":{"name":"dirkbonhomme","email":"dirk@bytelogic.be"},"_npmVersion":"3.6.0","_rev":"1-428f6217382bff4a4573bf5c72e5fbfa","_shasum":"f1806422e44223a39780bd33894a2fd8f77c9ffc","author":{"name":"Dirk Bonhomme","email":"dirk@bytelogic.be"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dirkbonhomme/pusher-js-auth/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"f1806422e44223a39780bd33894a2fd8f77c9ffc","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/pusher-js-auth/-/pusher-js-auth-2.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"dirkbonhomme","email":"dirk@bytelogic.be"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-05-17T10:05:58.315Z","created":"2016-02-16T20:15:15.688Z","1.2.0":"2016-02-16T20:15:15.688Z","2.0.0":"2016-05-17T10:05:58.315Z"}}}
