Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.\n`port`     | What HTTP port to serve on.

Defaults to `false`.\n`CORS`     | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing option (HTTP Header: \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\"). Defaults to \"*\".\n`serveDir` | Directory to serve as static assets. Defaults to the included [Robeaux][] installation.\n`ssl`      | SSL `key` and `cert` options, wrapped as an object. Set to `false` for an unsecured API.
