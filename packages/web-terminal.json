Supports mutiple sessions.\n\nNOTE: It is not a TTY emulator. It doesn't support complex TTY interaction like in vi, nano and etc. It's good only for simple command/response cases. For fully featured TTY emulator I would suggest [Wetty](https://github.com/krishnasrinivas/wetty) project.\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\nNode.js v0.10 or newer.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall from npm:\n\n    $ npm install web-terminal -g\n    \nUsage Examples\n--------------\n\n### Starting web-terminal:\n\n    $ web-terminal --port 8088\n\nOpen your favorite web browser, navigate to http://localhost:8088 and start playing with the browser based CLI.\n\n### Integrating web-terminal with web applications:\n```javascript\n\n    var http        = require(\"http\"),\n        terminal    = require(\"web-terminal\");\n\n    var app = http.createServer(function (req, res) {\n        res.writeHead(200, {\"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"});\n        res.end(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    });\n    \n    app.listen(1337);\n    console.log(\"Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/\");\n    \n    terminal(app);\n    console.log(\"Web-terminal accessible at http://127.0.0.1:1337/terminal\");\n    \n```\nStart the above application, then open your favorite browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8088/terminal\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n### Colors\nMost of the display VT100 escape sequences are translated to HTML. However, Web-terminal doesn't present itself as TTY and \ntherefore most programs won't output escape sequences to **stdout** unless they are explicitly instructed so.\n\nExample configurations:\n\n    $ git config --global color.ui always\n    \n    $ npm config set color always --global\n    \n### Shell commands\nTo execute commands through a shell such as bash or cmd.exe (for windows), an environment variable have to be set:\n\n    $ export WEB_SHELL=bash\n    \n### JavaScript REPL\nTo start the REPL, just type **node** without arguments in the browser. \nType **.exit** to return to the command prompt. \nNOTE: REPL is executed on the server, not in the brwoser.\n\nIssues\n------\nCommands that require interaction with TTY cause web-terminal to stop responding.\n\nFor instance, commands like sudo that require password from TTY directly cause web-terminal to stop responding. In this case the whole process has to be restarted.\n\nThe workaround for the time being is to issue sudo with -S argument to instruct sudo to ask for password on the standard IO. \nExample: \n\n    $ sudo -S apt-get install git-core\n\nFor Git, passwords have to be stored to avoid this problem:\n\n    $ git config credential.helper store\n\nSecurity Considerations\n-----------------------\nWeb-terminal does not provide embedded authentication and encryption mechanisms. \nTherefore, if the service is exposed to the Internet, it is strongly recommended to require TLS with client certificates or VPN connection.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Boyan Rabchev <boyan@rabchev.com>.
