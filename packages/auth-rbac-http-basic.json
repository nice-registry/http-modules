It is not compatible (and it probably never will) with versions >= 0.5 of auth-rbac, as auth-rbac no longer takes care of user authentication. You are encouraged to use [passport](http://passportjs.org/) for user *authentication*, while auth-rbac can still be used for user *authorization* (aka *access control*).
