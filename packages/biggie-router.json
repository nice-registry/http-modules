It draws inspiration from several popular open source frameworks\nand libraries, such as [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com/) and\n[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).\n\n\n## License\n\nBiggie-router is released under MIT, in hope you find this software useful.\n\n\n## Installing it\n\nThe fastest way to get started with biggie-router is to install it via **npm**.\n\n    $ npm install biggie-router\n\nOtherwise `git clone`, or download the repository and place the contents of the\n`lib` directory where needed.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nHere are a few basic examples.\n\nHello world, that listens on port 8080:\n\n    var http   = require('http')\n    var Router = require('biggie-router');\n    var server = http.createServer()\n    var router = new Router(server);\n\n    router.bind(function (request, response, next) {\n      next.sendBody(200, \"Hello World!\");\n    });\n\n    server.listen(8080);\n\n---\n\nBasic routing + chaining. Responds with hello world on root and `/index.html`\nget requests.\n\nRequests that fall through (don't match any conditions) get passed to the next\nroute and are sent a 404.\n\n    var Router = require('biggie-router');\n    var router = new Router();\n\n    router.get('/').get('/index.html')\n          .bind(function (request, response, next) {\n      next.sendBody(200, \"Hello World!\");\n    });\n\n    router.bind(function (request, response, next) {\n      next.sendBody(404, 'Resource \"' + request.url + '\" not found.');\n    });\n\n    router.listen(8080);\n\n---\n\nModules are functions that return a function, enabling you to do per-route\nsetup. No modules are supplied with biggie-router, however middleware use the\nsame pattern as connect (or express); so generic connect middleware should also\nbe compatible with biggie. The npm `middleware` module is also compatible.\n\nUsage is as follows:\n\n    var middleware = require('middleware');\n\n    router.get('/').bind(middleware.sendfile('public/'));\n\n    router.post('/users').bind(api('users', 'create'));\n\n","created":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","modified":"2013-06-12T03:19:11.440Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tim-smart","email":"tim@fostle.com"},"owners":[{"name":"tim-smart","email":"tim@fostle.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"biggie-router","_npmUser":{"name":"tim-smart","email":"tim@fostle.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.2.25","_rev":"1-003c2fd9eb4928adeec9d5c1632137de","author":{"name":"Tim Smart","email":"tim@fostle.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tim-smart/biggie-router/issues","email":"tim@fostle.com"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"c0810fa3bfaf61f7e5b3de8680f58d3e7a4805b1","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/biggie-router/-/biggie-router-1.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tim-smart","email":"tim@fostle.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-06-12T03:19:11.440Z","created":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.0":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.1":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.10":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.12":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.2":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.3":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.4":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.5":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.6":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.7":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.8":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.9":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.13":"2011-01-22T04:22:30.434Z","0.1.14":"2011-03-10T20:49:43.155Z","0.3.0":"2011-05-12T20:07:51.859Z","0.3.1":"2011-05-27T21:49:48.838Z","0.3.2":"2011-05-27T22:14:49.015Z","0.3.3":"2011-05-28T00:45:33.372Z","0.3.4":"2011-05-28T00:49:41.373Z","1.0.0":"2013-06-11T01:51:24.523Z","1.1.0":"2013-06-11T22:01:16.296Z","1.2.0":"2013-06-12T03:19:11.440Z"}}}
