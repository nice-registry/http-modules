It has a\nnumber of middlewares which is looks for routing rules in their respective\nsource. It also supports sticky session either based on cookies or remote\naddress.\n\nInternally is it using\n[NodeJitsu](https://github.com/nodejitsu)Â´s\n[node-http-proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy)\nlibrary to proxy the requests.\n\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar sepro = require('sepro')\n  , seaport = require('seaport')\n\nvar app = sepro()\n\napp.use(sepro.stickyCookie())\n\napp.use(sepro.haibu({ endpoint: 'http://haibu.example.com:9002/'\n                    , authToken: 'keyboard cat'\n                    , serverName: 'haibu.sepro.exaple.com'\n                    } ))\n\napp.use(sepro.seaport({ ports: seaport.connect(7000)\n                      , serverName: 'seaport.sepro.exaple.com'\n                      } ))\n\napp.use(sepro.apache( '/etc/apache2/httpd.conf' ))\n\napp.listen(8080)\n```\n\n## Install\n\n    npm install sepro\n\n## Licence\n\nMIT\n","created":"2012-08-25T15:35:24.192Z","modified":"2013-12-10T00:06:46.613Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tellnes","email":"christian@tellnes.no"},"owners":[{"name":"tellnes","email":"christian@tellnes.no"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"sepro","_npmUser":{"name":"tellnes","email":"christian@tellnes.no"},"_npmVersion":"1.2.32","_rev":"1-e3e67fc3c05da4ded32184d47c5ea629","author":{"name":"Christain Tellnes","email":"christian@tellnes.no"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tellnes/sepro/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.17"},"dist":{"shasum":"d73ecb12e496bfd780527a4d7ae16768c09e173f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/sepro/-/sepro-0.0.17.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tellnes","email":"christian@tellnes.no"}],"readmeFilename":"Readme.md","time":{"modified":"2013-12-10T00:06:46.613Z","created":"2012-08-25T15:35:24.192Z","0.0.1":"2012-08-25T15:35:25.669Z","0.0.2":"2012-08-25T16:54:55.581Z","0.0.3":"2012-08-25T17:55:43.327Z","0.0.4":"2012-08-25T18:08:32.211Z","0.0.5":"2012-08-25T19:02:04.526Z","0.0.6":"2012-08-25T19:10:48.722Z","0.0.7":"2012-08-25T19:41:21.002Z","0.0.8":"2012-08-25T20:58:37.867Z","0.0.9":"2012-08-25T21:01:13.797Z","0.0.10":"2012-08-25T21:19:50.920Z","0.0.11":"2012-08-25T21:42:23.935Z","0.0.12":"2012-09-04T06:27:40.359Z","0.0.13":"2012-10-10T12:42:44.109Z","0.0.14":"2013-06-21T15:04:33.794Z","0.0.15":"2013-06-21T15:14:48.564Z","0.0.16":"2013-11-21T23:44:28.472Z","0.0.17":"2013-12-10T00:06:46.613Z"}}}
