The idea behind this is that your entire project can use a simple prefix like `/api` in all of their urls and have them all rewritten at one location. This prevents code duplication.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n````bash\r\nnpm i ng-http-rewrite --save\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n````javascript\r\n// This is not a CommonJS module. If you're using Webpack just load it like this.\r\nvar angular = require('angular');\r\nrequire('ng-http-rewrite');\r\n\r\nangular.module('yourModule', ['lambdaexpression.httpRewrite'])\r\n  .config(function(httpRewriteProvider) {\r\n    // Note that the first argument is a regular expression.\r\n    // Do *not* include trailing slashes unless you want them to be removed.\r\n    // Everything that matches the regular expression is replaced with the\r\n    // secondary string.\r\n    httpRewriteProvider.rewrite(/^\\/api/, '/my/rewritten/location');\r\n  });\r\n````\r\n\r\nThere is no run-time API for the url rewriter and it *only works on outgoing $http requests*. It will not re-write the urls of incoming requests (not would it make any sense to).\r\nCheck tests for usage if you really need to.\r\n\r\n### Any issues?\r\n\r\nFeel free to open an issue if you have any issues or feature requests. Pull requests are also accepted providing you have tests (we're using jasmine/karma).\r\n","created":"2015-07-17T14:22:09.962Z","modified":"2015-07-21T21:56:27.613Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"danpantry","email":"dan@lambdaexpression.io"},"owners":[{"name":"danpantry","email":"dan@lambdaexpression.io"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ng-http-rewrite","_nodeVersion":"2.3.4","_npmUser":{"name":"danpantry","email":"dan@lambdaexpression.io"},"_npmVersion":"2.12.1","_rev":"1-07e38554430243bbba3a254f794df318","_shasum":"4e64596ec47a0a663a2aab4c572b87f49427e8c2","author":{"name":"Dan Pantry"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"4e64596ec47a0a663a2aab4c572b87f49427e8c2","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ng-http-rewrite/-/ng-http-rewrite-0.1.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"danpantry","email":"dan@lambdaexpression.io"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-07-21T21:56:27.613Z","created":"2015-07-17T14:22:09.962Z","0.1.0":"2015-07-17T14:22:09.962Z","0.1.1":"2015-07-21T21:56:27.613Z"}}}
