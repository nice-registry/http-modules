[shadowsocks](http://shadowsocks.org/en/index.html)). Since `npm` only support HTTP proxy, I wrote this simple command line module to fire up a HTTP Proxy server, then use it to tunnel requests to my SOCKS proxy.\n\n\n# Features\n\n* Supports HTTP and HTTPS requests\n* Built-in DNS cache\n* 150 loc, does nothing else\n\n\n# Install\n\n`npm install kneesocks --production -g`\n\n\n# Usage\n\n`kneesocks port1 port2`, eg. `kneesocks 10001 10002`\n\n* `port1` is the port your HTTP proxy server listen to on localhost.\n* `port2` is the port of your existing SOCKS proxy, also on localhost.\n\nThen you can set your npm config:\n\n* `npm config set http http://127.0.0.1:10001`\n* `npm config set https-proxy http://127.0.0.1:10001`\n\nTo revert proxy config, use `npm config delete http` and `npm config delete https-proxy`.\n\nTo debug, use `DEBUG=proxy kneesocks port1 port2`\n\n\n# Limit\n\n* Node v0.10+ required (Node v0.11+ preferred).\n* Probably not the best solution for day-to-day browsing, due to lack of remote dns and websocket support.\n* If you don't mind building binaries, use [DeleGate](http://www.delegate.org/delegate/) or [Polipo](http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~jch/software/polipo/) instead.\n\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/kneesocks.svg?style=flat-square\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/kneesocks\n[travis-image]: https://img.shields.io/travis/bitinn/kneesocks.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/bitinn/kneesocks\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-01-11T14:52:53.169Z","modified":"2016-11-22T17:09:05.286Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"bitinn","email":"bitinn@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"bitinn","email":"bitinn@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"kneesocks","_nodeVersion":"6.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/kneesocks-1.0.4.tgz_1479834543256_0.7673600949347019"},"_npmUser":{"name":"bitinn","email":"bitinn@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.0.3","_rev":"2-6a8858e2114b2342971bb862ea9c0ed6","_shasum":"d349399bf3c0b1b72595a90bf5d024c88275192e","author":{"name":"David Frank"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bitinn/kneesocks/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"d349399bf3c0b1b72595a90bf5d024c88275192e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/kneesocks/-/kneesocks-1.0.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"bitinn","email":"bitinn@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-11-22T17:09:05.286Z","created":"2015-01-11T14:52:53.169Z","0.1.0":"2015-01-11T14:52:53.169Z","1.0.0":"2015-01-11T16:53:59.337Z","1.0.1":"2015-01-11T17:00:44.686Z","1.0.2":"2015-01-11T17:16:57.923Z","1.0.3":"2015-01-11T18:04:36.703Z","1.0.4":"2016-11-22T17:09:05.286Z"},"users":{"dreamanddead":true}}}
