// will only ping server between 9am and 5pm\r\n```\r\n_Special notes for advanced case:_\r\n\r\n- `wakeTime` and `sleepTime` may be decimal or whole number form, but must be JavaScript numbers greater than 0 and less-than or equal to 12, representing a time along a 12-hour clock.\r\n- A.M. / P.M. options are passed in via `wakeAm` and `sleepAm` respectively, where `true` will correspond to A.M., and `false` will convert the supplied number into it's respective P.M. form\r\n","created":"2017-03-28T08:01:34.044Z","modified":"2017-05-07T16:19:14.383Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"joeco","email":"joe@joeco.info"},"owners":[{"name":"joeco","email":"joe@joeco.info"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"periodic-ping","_nodeVersion":"6.10.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/periodic-ping-2.0.0.tgz_1494173953211_0.07862169970758259"},"_npmUser":{"name":"joeco","email":"joe@joeco.info"},"_npmVersion":"4.5.0","_rev":"5-c416feae5d28ea4e9675af4efe2cd1da","_shasum":"d50eb3d936c1ca74a89feac4e5c353d4ebff3043","author":{"name":"Joe Costanzo","email":"joe@joeco.info","url":"https://github.com/JoeCostanzo"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/JoeCostanzo/periodic-ping/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"d50eb3d936c1ca74a89feac4e5c353d4ebff3043","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/periodic-ping/-/periodic-ping-2.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"joeco","email":"joe@joeco.info"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-07T16:19:14.383Z","created":"2017-03-28T08:01:34.044Z","1.0.0":"2017-03-28T08:01:34.044Z","1.0.1":"2017-03-28T08:51:10.787Z","1.0.2":"2017-03-28T10:08:42.910Z","1.0.333":"2017-03-28T10:12:43.333Z","2.0.0":"2017-05-07T16:19:14.383Z"}}}
