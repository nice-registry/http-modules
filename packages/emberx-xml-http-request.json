These actions are just JavaScript functions that are attached\nto the object yielded into the template.\n\n### send(data: String | Blob | ArrayBufferView | FormData)\n\nUse this action to initiate the request and start transferring\nbytes. The optional `data` parameter will be used as the body of the\nrequest.  E.g.\n\n``` handlebars\n{{! send a string}}\n<button {{action (action xhr.send \"Hello World\")}}>Say Hello To Server</button>\n\n{{! send a file}}\n<button {{action (action xhr.send file)}}>Send File</button>\n\n{{! etc...}}\n```\nSee [XMLHttpRequest#send()][2] for more about the valid types for data.\n\n\n### abort()\n\nCancel the current request.\n\n``` handlebars\n<button {{action (action xhr.abort)}}>Cancel</button>\n```\n\n\n### reset()\n\nRecreate the request entirely and start from scratch. This is useful\nif you have aborted a request, or it times out, and you want to send\nit again, but nothing else about the request has changed.\n\n``` handlebars\n<button {{action (pipe xhr.reset (action xhr.send file))}}>Retry</button>\n```\n\n## State\n\nAll of the properties of the the `xhr` param, including `readyState`,\n`status`, `response`, `responseText`, etc... are reactive\nand can be bound to in templates, and can also be used as the input\nfor other computed properties.\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  readyState: 0,\n  requestHeaders: {},\n  responseHeaders: {},\n  responseType: 'json'\n  response: '',\n  responseText: '',\n  responseXML: '',\n  isLoadStarted: false, // alias for download.isLoadStarted\n  isLoadEnded: false,   // alias for download.isLoadEnded\n  isAborted: false,     // alias for download.isAborted\n  isErrored: false,     // alias for download.isErrored\n  isTimedOut: false,    // alias for download.isTimedOut\n  download: {\n    isLoadStarted: false,\n    isLoadEnded: false,\n    isAborted: false,\n    isErrored: false,\n    isLengthComputable: false,\n    total: 0,\n    loaded: 0,\n    ratio: 0,\n    percentage: 0\n  },\n  upload: {\n    isLoadStarted: false,\n    isLoadEnded: false,\n    isAborted: false,\n    isErrored: false,\n    isLengthComputable: false,\n    total: 0,\n    loaded: 0,\n    ratio: 0,\n    percentage: 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is particularly useful in tracking the progress of an upload or a\ndownload.\n\nBecause `xhr` radiates all information about its progress, building\nUIs to track it are a snap.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nember install emberx-xml-http-request\n```\n\n[1]: https://github.com/cowboyd/x-request.js\n[2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#send()\n\n## Code of Conduct\nPlease note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of\nConduct.
