This can be used as the default handler when only sub-routes are required.\n* __JSONRoute__ - Simple route which handles JSON parsing of the message body object. Expects extending classes to implement `respond (request, response, data)`\n\n## Usage Example\n\n    const BasicHTTPServer = require(\"basic-http-server\");\n\n    const fileHandler = new BasicHTTPServer.StaticFileServer(\"/\", \"./\", \"index.html\");\n    const httpServer = new BasicHTTPServer({port: 8080});\n    httpServer.registerDefaultHandler(fileHandler);\n    httpServer.start();\n","created":"2016-03-07T21:36:53.025Z","modified":"2017-02-06T15:47:46.566Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"drlabman","email":"chris.hallson@gluonporridge.net"},"owners":[{"name":"drlabman","email":"chris.hallson@gluonporridge.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-server-basic","_nodeVersion":"5.12.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http-server-basic-0.0.9.tgz_1472834923808_0.32797397719696164"},"_npmUser":{"name":"drlabman","email":"chris.hallson@gluonporridge.net"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"3-ad8f17a05ecf0ab1e63295a9292393d7","_shasum":"95c63965a8e848bb872ebffe8567be4c87913043","author":{"name":"Chris Hallson"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/DrLabman/basic-http-server/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.9"},"dist":{"shasum":"95c63965a8e848bb872ebffe8567be4c87913043","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-server-basic/-/http-server-basic-0.0.9.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"drlabman","email":"chris.hallson@gluonporridge.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-02-06T15:47:46.566Z","created":"2016-03-07T21:36:53.025Z","0.0.1":"2016-03-07T21:36:53.025Z","0.0.2":"2016-03-07T22:12:09.271Z","0.0.3":"2016-05-24T16:01:50.721Z","0.0.4":"2016-05-27T09:06:44.727Z","0.0.5":"2016-09-01T16:34:57.152Z","0.0.6":"2016-09-01T16:48:11.415Z","0.0.7":"2016-09-02T16:13:48.607Z","0.0.8":"2016-09-02T16:20:10.875Z","0.0.9":"2016-09-02T16:48:45.781Z"}}}
