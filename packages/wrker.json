Runs multiple times at different\nconnection counts, averages multiple tests, graphs results, and more.\n\n![Image of wrk doing its thing in the browser...](https://files.app.net/7t9h2OeFd.png)\n\n## Installation\n\nWrker uses node. You'll need to install `wrk` and `node` before installing wrk:\n\n`npm install -g wrk`\n\n## Usage\n\n#### Example\n\n`wrker -i 100 -d 1 -a 3 -s 5 -r browser http://127.0.0.1:3000/`\n\n* Run wrk for 100 iterations\n\t* for 1 second each\n\t* each iteration should be an average of three runs\n* stepping up by five connections each iteration\n* using the `browser` reporter\n* hitting the server `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`\n\n#### Full Guide\n\n\tUsage: wrker [options] <url...>\n\t\n\tOptions:\n\t\n\t  -h, --help                output usage information\n\t  -V, --version             output the version number\n\t  -v --verbose              Verbose mode\n\t  -i --iterations <number>  The number of test iterations/increments to run (default 10)\n\t  -d --duration <number>    The duration in seconds for each test (default 5)\n\t  -a --averageOf <number>   The number of repeat tests to run at each stepping interval (default 3)\n\t  -s --stepBy <number>      The number of concurrent connections to step up by each iteration (default 10)\n\t  -r --reporter <value>     The reporter to use (defaults to console.) Use one of: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  * csv\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  * console\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  * browser (experimental)\n\n## Notes\n\nThere are some rough edges:\n\n* I got lazy and haven't yet written tests\n* Parsing of wrk data which uses SI prefixes is not yet implemented\n* The browser reporter is currently pretty basic. It doesn't currently display\n  a bunch of stuff you'd definitely want from graphs: scales/axes,\n  item labels and counts, comparison scatterplots, overlay latency stats on the\n  same graph, and much more. **I'm getting to this.**\n\n## Licence\n\nCopyright (c) 2015, Christopher Giffard\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose\nwith or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice\nand this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH\nREGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS.
