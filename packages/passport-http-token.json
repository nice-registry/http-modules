Bearer tokens are typically used protect API endpoints,\nand are often issued using OAuth 2.0.\n\nBy plugging into Passport, bearer token support can be easily and unobtrusively\nintegrated into any application or framework that supports\n[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including\n[Express](http://expressjs.com/).\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install passport-http-token\n\n## Usage\n\n#### Configure Strategy\n\nThe HTTP Bearer authentication strategy authenticates users using a bearer\ntoken.  The strategy requires a `validate` callback, which accepts that\ncredential and calls `done` providing a user.  Optional `info` can be passed,\ntypically including associated scope, which will be set by Passport at\n`req.authInfo` to be used by later middleware for authorization and access\ncontrol.\n\n    passport.use(new BearerStrategy(\n      function(token, done) {\n        User.findOne({ token: token }, function (err, user) {\n          if (err) { return done(err); }\n          if (!user) { return done(null, false); }\n          return done(null, user, { scope: 'all' });\n        });\n      }\n    ));\n\n#### Authenticate Requests\n\nUse `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'bearer'` strategy, to\nauthenticate requests.  Requests containing bearer tokens do not require session\nsupport, so the `session` option can be set to `false`.\n\nFor example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)\napplication:\n\n    app.get('/profile', \n      passport.authenticate('bearer', { session: false }),\n      function(req, res) {\n        res.json(req.user);\n      });\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis module is based on the HTTP-Bearer strategy by Jared Hanson, this is just my modifications to make tokens acceptable by HTTP Username, modelled on stripe.\n\n## Examples\n\nFor a complete, working example, refer to the [Bearer example](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-http-bearer/tree/master/examples/bearer).\n\n## Tests\n\n    $ npm install --dev\n    $ make test\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jaredhanson/passport-http-bearer.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jaredhanson/passport-http-bearer)\n\n## Credits\n\n  - [Jared Hanson](http://github.com/jaredhanson)\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Jared Hanson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
