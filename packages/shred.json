Overview\n\nShred is an HTTP client that wraps HTTP interfaces so you can easily create CoffeeScript or JavaScript clients.\n\nDefine your client:\n\n```coffeescript\ngithub = resource \"https://api.github.com/\",\n  repo: (resource) ->\n    resource \"repos/{owner}/{repo}/\",\n      issues: (resource) ->\n        resource \"issues\",\n          create:\n            method: \"post\"\n            headers:\n              accept: \"application/vnd.github.v3.raw+json\"\n            expect: 201\n          list:\n            method: \"get\"\n            headers:\n              accept: \"application/vnd.github.v3.raw+json\"\n            expect: 200\n```\n\nAnd then use it:\n\n```coffeescript\ntry\n  {data} = yield github\n    .repo {owner, repo}\n    .issues\n    .list()\n  console.log number, title for {number, title} in (yield data)\ncatch error\n  console.error error\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install shred\n```\n\n## Status\n\nShred 1.0.x is a complete reboot of the project. The goal is the same, but the interface has changed drastically. Shred 1.0.x is _not_ backwards compatible with earlier versions.\n\nShred is presently `alpha` quality code, as designated by the version suffix.\n\n## Description\n\nHTTP is a rich protocol, but the low-level details of setting headers and checking response codes muck up our code. So we either ignore these nuances or write wrapper functions to hide the details.\n\nShred makes it easy to declaratively create API wrapper functions. Shred also features support for URL templates, response compression, authorization, and streaming responses. And more features are coming soon!\n\n## API\n\n* `resource`: Define a resource. Takes a URL, path, or URL template, and an interface declaration.\n\n### Interface Definitions\n\nInterface definitions are an object whose properties define subresources or request methods on the resource being defined.\n\nIf a property contains an object, it will be defined as a request method described the object.\n\nIf it contains a function, the property will define a subresource for which the function is the initializer.\n\n### Request Method Descriptions\n\nRequest method descriptions can include three properties:\n\n* `method`: The HTTP method used to make the request, ex: `GET`, `PUT`.\n\n* `headers`: An object describing the HTTP headers to send with the request, ex: `content-type`, `accept`.\n\n* `expect`: The expected HTTP status code, ex: `200`. Other status codes will be treated as errors.\n\n### Subresource Initializer Functions\n\nThe signature for resource initializers is:\n\n```coffeescript\n(resource) ->\n```\n\nThe `resource` function passed into the initializer functions works just as the `resource` exported by Shred. You can use it to define the subresource.\n\nTypically, you'll want to use paths or template URLs to define subresources, which will be concatenated with the parent resources' URLs.\n\nSubresources defined using URL templates will be functions, allowing you to pass in an object whose key-value pairs will instantiate the template.\n\n### Shred Responses\n\nWhen you invoke a Shred request functions, you get back a response context. This contains both the HTTP response object and a data object. The data object is a promise that resolves when the response body is finished streaming. If the `content-type` appears to be JSON-based, Shred will parse the response body as JSON and return an object, otherwise, it will return a string.\n\n### Explicit Invocation\n\nYou can explicit invoke Shred request functions using the `invoke` command. This is particularly useful when using helper functions defined on the request function, such as `authorize`.\n\n### Authorization With Shred\n\nYou can use the `authorization` method defined on request functions to pass authorization information into the request. The `authorization` function takes a object describing the authorization scheme. Currently, `basic` and `bearer` are supported.\n\n#### Example\n\n```coffeescript\ntry\n  yield github\n    .repo {owner, repo}\n    .issues\n    .create\n    .authorize basic: {username: token, password: \"\"}\n    .invoke {title, body}\n```\n","created":"2011-11-22T16:30:44.071Z","modified":"2015-12-14T03:17:33.406Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"dyoder","email":"danielyoder@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"dyoder","email":"danielyoder@gmail.com"},{"name":"automatthew","email":"mking@spire.io"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"shred","_nodeVersion":"4.2.0","_npmUser":{"name":"dyoder","email":"danielyoder@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.7","_rev":"1-a44d8296db1cb4cddc4bb5af9f367440","_shasum":"2917ea63d087172f77584bc9a88a4b7abebbbd4d","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/pandastrike/shred/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.0-alpha-10"},"dist":{"shasum":"2917ea63d087172f77584bc9a88a4b7abebbbd4d","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/shred/-/shred-1.1.0-alpha-10.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"dyoder","email":"danielyoder@gmail.com"},{"name":"automatthew","email":"mking@spire.io"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-12-14T03:17:33.406Z","created":"2011-11-22T16:30:44.071Z","0.0.5":"2011-11-22T16:30:45.378Z","0.5.0":"2011-11-22T16:37:33.928Z","0.5.2":"2011-11-22T16:59:00.622Z","0.5.3":"2011-11-22T18:39:12.134Z","0.5.4":"2011-11-22T18:42:47.966Z","0.5.5":"2011-11-22T19:36:59.269Z","0.6.0":"2011-12-06T19:23:01.206Z","0.6.1":"2011-12-06T20:37:15.758Z","0.6.4":"2011-12-12T22:32:24.957Z","0.6.5":"2012-01-18T23:01:37.468Z","0.6.6":"2012-01-18T23:46:55.893Z","0.6.7":"2012-01-19T01:38:11.019Z","0.6.8":"2012-01-19T23:55:52.135Z","0.7.0":"2012-01-20T03:00:39.084Z","0.7.1":"2012-02-01T19:05:24.702Z","0.7.2":"2012-02-02T23:47:47.567Z","0.7.3":"2012-02-03T02:01:51.024Z","0.7.4":"2012-02-03T19:27:55.409Z","0.7.5":"2012-02-05T23:18:55.712Z","0.7.6":"2012-02-15T19:15:06.146Z","0.7.9":"2012-02-29T20:14:52.696Z","0.7.10":"2012-03-02T21:00:23.648Z","0.7.11":"2012-03-05T18:31:02.195Z","0.7.12":"2012-03-22T19:30:24.180Z","0.7.13":"2012-03-31T02:03:21.367Z","0.7.14":"2012-04-04T19:42:42.074Z","0.7.15":"2012-04-06T17:11:55.572Z","0.7.16":"2012-05-02T20:17:27.120Z","0.7.17":"2012-05-04T18:27:07.871Z","0.7.18":"2012-05-04T18:55:02.789Z","0.8.0":"2012-05-16T20:17:13.702Z","0.8.1":"2012-05-16T23:46:26.996Z","0.8.2":"2012-06-06T06:50:45.165Z","0.8.3":"2012-06-28T18:54:56.878Z","0.8.6":"2012-10-01T17:02:51.175Z","0.8.8":"2012-11-07T21:45:33.815Z","0.8.9":"2013-07-15T22:37:27.055Z","0.8.10":"2014-02-24T18:32:39.222Z","1.0.0-alpha-01":"2014-08-05T19:41:56.616Z","1.0.0-alpha-02":"2014-08-05T19:51:24.744Z","1.0.0-alpha-03":"2014-08-05T19:59:06.280Z","1.0.0-alpha-04":"2014-08-14T03:41:40.618Z","1.0.0-alpha-05":"2014-09-11T03:06:52.270Z","1.0.0-alpha-06":"2014-09-11T04:06:38.640Z","1.0.0-alpha-07":"2014-09-11T17:43:06.145Z","1.1.0-alpha-01":"2014-11-03T03:30:41.152Z","1.1.0-alpha-02":"2014-12-08T00:47:51.905Z","1.1.0-alpha-03":"2014-12-08T00:54:11.936Z","1.1.0-alpha-04":"2015-03-26T18:17:35.657Z","1.1.0-alpha-05":"2015-03-29T04:09:10.230Z","1.1.0-alpha-06":"2015-03-29T04:12:04.105Z","1.1.0-alpha-07":"2015-05-14T06:30:31.022Z","1.1.0-alpha-08":"2015-05-16T00:46:30.506Z","1.1.0-alpha-09":"2015-12-14T02:06:31.269Z","1.1.0-alpha-10":"2015-12-14T03:17:33.406Z"}}}
