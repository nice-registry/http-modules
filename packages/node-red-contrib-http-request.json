It supports a lot of features/options for advanced usage. \r\n\r\nA simple example : The node-red-contrib-http-request module support HTTPS on HTTP proxy using CONNECT request. This is not feasible using the Core Node-RED HTTP Request module.  \r\n\r\nBy contributing to our http request node, you'll be supporting an evolutive and robust HTTP client for Node-RED. \r\n\r\n","created":"2016-08-02T16:26:43.596Z","modified":"2017-06-12T13:34:48.417Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"spawnrider","email":"spawnrider@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"medchekir","email":"medchkir@gmail.com"},{"name":"spawnrider","email":"spawnrider@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-red-contrib-http-request","_nodeVersion":"6.9.4","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/node-red-contrib-http-request-0.1.9.tgz_1497274487384_0.6689121483359486"},"_npmUser":{"name":"spawnrider","email":"spawnrider@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.1.2","_rev":"5-24fc2a10425977db051fd88641a9b0b0","_shasum":"b2a1c34b4d3797ff7c20d98e1b9f5d8370ff2405","author":{"name":"Yohann Ciurlik","email":"spawnrider@gmail.com","url":"https://github.com/spawnrider"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/spawnrider/node-red-contrib-http-request/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Yohann Ciurlik","email":"spawnrider@gmail.com","url":"https://github.com/spawnrider"},{"name":"Mohamed Chekir","email":"medchkir@gmail.com","url":"https://github.com/medchkir"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.9"},"dist":{"shasum":"b2a1c34b4d3797ff7c20d98e1b9f5d8370ff2405","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/node-red-contrib-http-request/-/node-red-contrib-http-request-0.1.9.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"medchekir","email":"medchkir@gmail.com"},{"name":"spawnrider","email":"spawnrider@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-12T13:34:48.417Z","created":"2016-08-02T16:26:43.596Z","0.1.0":"2016-08-02T16:26:43.596Z","0.1.1":"2016-08-02T16:27:36.301Z","0.1.2":"2016-08-02T17:34:08.480Z","0.1.3":"2016-08-02T17:38:00.545Z","0.1.4":"2016-08-05T14:30:29.650Z","0.1.5":"2016-08-11T13:14:31.086Z","0.1.6":"2017-01-11T17:37:28.080Z","0.1.7":"2017-05-03T14:21:25.240Z","0.1.8":"2017-05-03T14:24:52.232Z","0.1.9":"2017-06-12T13:34:48.417Z"}}}
