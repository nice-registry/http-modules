The *JSON* file rulz are dynamically updated on file change.\n\nUsage instructions are described below.\n\n## Usage\n\nBasic usage after getting the sources:\n\n\tnpm install\n\t./bin/proxy-server --table examples/simple-proxy.json\n\nYou can also retrieve it from the npm registry:\n\n\tnpm install -g http-proxy-rulz\n\tproxy-server --table any-rulz-of-your-own.json\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny contributions are welcome, please report any issue or merge request of your wish.\n\n## Licence\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Clément Désiles\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
