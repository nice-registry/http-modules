It will look like this:\n\n```\n[www.chilts.org]\ntype=redirect\nto=chilts.org\n```\n\nThat's all you need to do for proxie to redirect every request on that site to the naked domain.\n\n## Installation ##\n\n```\n$ npm install -g proxie\n```\n\nThen you can just run:\n\n```bash\n$ proxie\n```\n\nIf you need to bind to port 80, then either run it as root (not receommended) or use\n[authbind](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~ian/git/authbind.git/)\nto let you bind to port 80 as an unprivileged user.\n\n```bash\n$ sudo apt-get install authbind\n$ sudo touch /etc/authbind/byport/80\n$ sudo chown $USER /etc/authbind/byport/80\n$ sudo chmod 500 /etc/authbind/byport/80\n$ proxie\n```\n\n## Built in Strategies ##\n\nYou can build your own strategies for proxie, but the following is the set that comes with proxie.\n\n### proxy ###\n\nThis strategy will proxy every request through to another server. For example if you are running a site called\n`cssminifier.com` on port 3000 on the same host, you would use the following strategy:\n\n```\n[cssminifier.com]\ntype=proxy\nhost=localhost\nport=3000\n```\n### round-robin ###\n\nThis strategy will proxy every request through to another server which it will pick (round-robin) from the\nlist provided. For example if you are running a site called `javascript-minifier.com` on port 3001 on the\nthree different hosts, you would use the following strategy:\n\n```\n[javascript-minifier.com]\ntype=round-robin\nhosts=bohr:3001,einstein:3001,tesla:3001\n```\n\nThis assume `bohr`, `einstein` and `tesla` resolve correctly on this host. You may use IP addresses if you\nwant to.\n\n```\n[javascript-minifier.com]\ntype=round-robin\nhosts=10.0.0.5:3001,10.0.0.6:3001,10.0.0.7:3001\n```\n\nOr just have multiple servers on localhost. Whatever works for you.\n\n```\n[javascript-minifier.com]\ntype=round-robin\nhosts=localhost:8888,localhost:8889\n```\n\n### redirect ###\n\nA redirect site will look like, and so every request to `http://www.chilts.org/$1` will be 301 redirected to\n`http://chilts.org/$1`:\n\n```\n[www.chilts.org]\ntype=redirect\nto=chilts.org\n```\n\n### static ###\n\nProxie can also serve static sites out of the box. To do this use the following config:\n\n```\n[awssum.io]\ntype=static\ndir=/path/to/awssum-io/htdocs\n```\n\n### not-found ###\n\nThis seems like a strange thing to for a domain but it comes in useful for proxie if it receives a request for a\nsite that is unknown. It was made into a strategy so that it could be re-used. All it does is return a `404 - Not\nfound` for every request to that domain.\n\n```\n[old.example.com]\ntype=not-found\n```\n\n### Your own Stragey ###\n\nOr you can write your own strategy (I'd love a PR if it's a generic strategy). If it's something that could be useful\nto everyone, let me know. :)\n\n## Config File ##\n\nProxie reads the config file `/etc/proxie.ini` to get some settings. Currently the only setting read is\n`port`. An example config file is:\n\n```\nport=80\n```\n\n## /etc/proxie.d/ ##\n\nSo that Proxie knows which sites to proxy, you should put files into the `/etc/proxie.d/` directory. An\nexample config file for a simple site might be:\n\ne.g. `/etc/proxie.d/chilts-org`:\n\n```\n[www.chilts.org]\ntype=redirect\nto=chilts.org\n\n[chilts.org]\ntype=proxy\nhost=localhost\nport=3000\n```\n\nAs you can see, all requests on the `www.chilts.org` subdomain will be redirected to the naked domain.\n\nAll requests on the naked domain will be proxied through to `localhost:3000`.\n\nIt is up to your blog site to install a relevant file into `/etc/proxie.d/` so that proxie knows where to\nproxy the site.\n\nAn example config you might use when locally developing a site could be:\n\n```\n[chilts.localhost]\ntype=proxy\nhost=localhost\nport=3000\n```\n\n# Author #\n\nWritten by [Andrew Chilton](http://chilts.org/) - [Blog](http://chilts.org/blog/) -\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/andychilton).\n\n# License #\n\n* [Copyright 2013 Andrew Chilton.
