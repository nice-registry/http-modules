It is not expected that applications will interact directly with this package.\n\n### Usage\n\nA `Logger` is configured with `serverUrl`, and optionally `apiKey` as well as event and batch size limits.\n\n```js\nlet process = require('process');\nlet seq = require('seq-logging');\n\nlet logger = new seq.Logger({ serverUrl: 'http://localhost:5341' });\n\nlogger.emit({\n    timestamp: new Date(),\n    level: 'Information',\n    messageTemplate: 'Hello for the {n}th time, {user}!',\n    properties: {\n        user: process.env.USERNAME,\n        n: 20\n    }\n});\n\nlogger.close();\n```\n\nEvents are sent using the `emit()` method, that internally performs asynchronous batching based on payload size.\n\nWhen the application exits, `close()` ensures all buffered events are written. This can be done at any time otherwise using the `flush()` method. Both of these methods return promises indicating completion.\n\n### Implementations\n\n * [bunyan-seq](https://github.com/continuousit/bunyan-seq) - collect events from the Buyan logging framework\n \n","created":"2016-03-25T07:07:15.077Z","modified":"2016-05-03T04:13:17.706Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"nblumhardt","email":"nblumhardt@nblumhardt.com"},"owners":[{"name":"nblumhardt","email":"nblumhardt@nblumhardt.com"},{"name":"seq","email":"support@getseq.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"seq-logging","_nodeVersion":"4.2.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/seq-logging-0.1.6.tgz_1462248796566_0.5932698447722942"},"_npmUser":{"name":"nblumhardt","email":"nblumhardt@nblumhardt.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.8","_rev":"1-5424b819728afdc26c54d9087c6d9ac9","_shasum":"3afbffa5b25484971a36f8a352dd30ef988c8bdd","author":{"name":"Continous IT and contributors"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/continuousit/seq-logging/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"3afbffa5b25484971a36f8a352dd30ef988c8bdd","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/seq-logging/-/seq-logging-0.1.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"nblumhardt","email":"nblumhardt@nblumhardt.com"},{"name":"seq","email":"support@getseq.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-05-03T04:13:17.706Z","created":"2016-03-25T07:07:15.077Z","0.0.1":"2016-03-25T07:07:15.077Z","0.1.0":"2016-03-25T11:03:32.114Z","0.1.1":"2016-03-28T03:48:45.749Z","0.1.2":"2016-03-28T04:03:35.942Z","0.1.3":"2016-03-31T00:33:42.383Z","0.1.4":"2016-04-26T21:26:08.371Z","0.1.5":"2016-04-27T09:08:55.695Z","0.1.6":"2016-05-03T04:13:17.706Z"}}}
