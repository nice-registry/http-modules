That's why it depends on environment variables, this makes it easy to use the tool in a CI pipeline.\n\n## Usage\n### initialise environment\n`\nnpm install\n`\n\nThis will install/update all the required modules for running the tests\n\nAlso a composer wrapper is provided, implemented to keep our own jenkins as stupid as possible ;)\n\n### Run tests\n`\nENDPOINT_PATHS=<path/to/paths/file.json> ENDPOINT_HOST=<host>:<port> SITE_URI=<FQDN> ./node_modules/.bin/mocha --ui tdd\n`\n\n## Adding paths to test\nSelect the project in resources\nOpen paths.json\nand add the following stanza:\n\n``` json\n[\n    {\n            \"path\": \"/api/info\",\n            \"method\": \"GET\",\n            \"headers\": {\n                \"header1\": \"value1\",\n                \"header2\": \"value2\"\n            },\n            \"statusCode\": [200, 302],\n            \"public\": 1,\n            \"secure\": 0,\n            \"requireFQDN\": 0,\n            \"timeout\": 500\n    },\n    {\n        // another stanza\n    }\n]\n```\n\npath: path to test  \nmethod: GET,POST, PUT or PATCH  \nstatuscode: [statuscode(s)]  \npublic: should endpoint be available in production  \nsecure: use http or https  (needs to be implemented)\ntimeout: timeout in milliseconds  \nrequireFQDN: mark a test as optional or required when an site uri has been specified. ( optional parameter )\n\npublic and secure are not implemented yet.\n\nNOTE on site_uri: this will be set as host header in the request object as demanded by the HTTP1.1 standard, but the request/request implementation will use this value as proxy.\nSo when the tested host is not identical to the site_uri, you are strongly advised to specify followRedirects to false.\n\n## Resources\n  - [Request class for node.js](https://github.com/mikeal/request)\n  - [Mocha test framework](http://http://mochajs.org/)\n  - [Chai assertion library](https://github.com/chaijs/chai)\n\n## Todo\n - implement https support\n\n","created":"2015-10-23T08:15:55.936Z","modified":"2015-12-16T13:19:50.402Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mtishauser","email":"merlijn@gargleblaster.org"},"owners":[{"name":"mtishauser","email":"merlijn@gargleblaster.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-endpoint-tester","_nodeVersion":"5.1.1","_npmUser":{"name":"mtishauser","email":"merlijn@gargleblaster.org"},"_npmVersion":"3.3.12","_rev":"1-4b1f6b598618f674d4273c06c1e91867","_shasum":"2e10c03b676ea13466d7e0b5ec04b5c6b7944ec5","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/psybizz/http-endpoint-tester/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"2e10c03b676ea13466d7e0b5ec04b5c6b7944ec5","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-endpoint-tester/-/http-endpoint-tester-1.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mtishauser","email":"merlijn@gargleblaster.org"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-12-16T13:19:50.402Z","created":"2015-10-23T08:15:55.936Z","0.1.2":"2015-10-23T08:15:55.936Z","1.0.1":"2015-12-16T13:04:59.444Z","1.0.3":"2015-12-16T13:19:50.402Z"}}}
