It is recommended that you configure requests and responses to be sent to different paths (resource endpoints) on your ICAP server. \n\nThe best documentation is the example and tests, which demonstrate example ICAP requests, ICAP handling, and ICAP responses.\n\n## API Configuration\n\n### `server.options(path, next)`\nAllows configuration of a given ICAP endpoint. To set the options for endpoint `/squid/configured/request-path`, you could use:\n\n\t# server.js\n\tserver.options('/squid/configured/request-path', function(icapReq, icapRes, next) {\n\t  icapRes.setIcapStatusCode(200);\n\t  icapRes.setIcapHeaders({\n\t    'Methods': 'REQMOD',\n\t    'Preview': '128'\n\t  });\n\t  icapRes.writeHeaders(false);\n\t  icapRes.end();\n\t});\n\n## API Routing\n\n**nodecap** presents an expressjs-style API where middleware can be declared and matched to requests. Instead of request URI/method combinations, the unit of matching is domains through the `DomainList` class, which implements an efficient matcher for squid3 whitelist/blacklist syntax. Middlware is attached to handle requests to / responses from lists of domains:\n\n### `server.request(domainList, next)`\nAdds middleware to handle a REQMOD (HTTP request modification). The callback signature is `callback(icapRequest, icapResponse, httpRequest, httpResponse, next)`. Calling `next()` is optional and will continue to the next handler. Be sure to have a catch-all handler at the end. `domainList` can be either a DomainList instance - which allows matching request domains against a configured list - or the literal string`\"*\"` to match all requests.\n\n### `server.response(domainList, next)`\nAdds middleware to handle a RESPMOD (HTTP response modification). The `domainList` and `next` options are the same as for `server.request`.\n\n### `server.error(err, icapReq, icapRes, next)`\nAdds middleware to handle errors that occur either at the protocol level or within any options/request/response middleware.\n\n\n### License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Joseph Savona\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
