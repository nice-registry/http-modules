Note that Pushed resources will also appear on the global event emitter.\n\n# Agents\n\nThis functionality relies on `spdy`. In default cases where no agent is specified or a new agent is requested (via the `agent: false` option), Event-WebPush will create a spdy agent, which is required for Push capability.\n","created":"2015-10-15T19:02:55.587Z","modified":"2015-10-15T19:02:55.587Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"rektide","email":"rektide@voodoowarez.com"},"owners":[{"name":"rektide","email":"rektide@voodoowarez.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"event-webpush","_npmUser":{"name":"rektide","email":"rektide@voodoowarez.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.21","_rev":"1-da09d2d26eb42dd11ac70a497a6b73d8","_shasum":"0494d6de8c17f44f8248e353dc04fca1cb0182f4","author":{"name":"rektide de la faye"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"0494d6de8c17f44f8248e353dc04fca1cb0182f4","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/event-webpush/-/event-webpush-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"rektide","email":"rektide@voodoowarez.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-10-15T19:02:55.587Z","created":"2015-10-15T19:02:55.587Z","1.0.0":"2015-10-15T19:02:55.587Z"}}}
