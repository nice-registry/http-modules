Intended for local development only. Based off of [local-ssl-proxy](https://github.com/cameronhunter/local-ssl-proxy).\n\n```\nUsage: dev-proxy [options]\n\nOptions:\n\n  -h, --help                  output usage information\n  -V, --version               output the version number\n  -p --proxy <source:target>  ports to proxy\n  -k --key [keyPath]          optional path to key file\n  -c --cert [certPath]        optional path to cert file\n  -h --host [hostname]        optional hostname\n```\n\nInstall\n-------\n```sh\nnpm install -g dev-proxy\n# will automatically generate a self-signed cert/key\n```\n\nRun\n---\nTo start a proxying from port `9000` to `9001` run:\n```sh\ndev-proxy --proxy 9000:9001\n```\n\nStart your web server on the source port (`9000` in the example) and navigate to `https://localhost:<target-port>` ([https://localhost:9001](https://localhost:9001) in the example). You'll get a warning because the certificate is self-signed, this is safe to ignore during development.\n\nTo create multiple proxies run:\n```sh\ndev-proxy --proxy 8080:8443 --proxy 9080:9443\n```\n","versions":[{"number":"1.0.0","date":"2015-04-26T20:18:02.370Z"},{"number":"1.0.1","date":"2015-04-29T04:38:05.501Z"},{"number":"1.0.2","date":"2015-04-29T04:53:01.201Z"},{"number":"1.0.3","date":"2015-04-29T05:08:06.553Z"},{"number":"1.0.4","date":"2015-04-29T05:11:17.382Z"},{"number":"1.0.5","date":"2015-04-29T05:15:22.233Z"},{"number":"1.0.6","date":"2015-04-29T05:20:39.484Z"},{"number":"1.0.7","date":"2015-04-29T05:23:11.092Z"},{"number":"1.0.8","date":"2015-04-29T05:25:39.718Z"},{"number":"1.0.9","date":"2015-04-29T05:38:15.437Z"},{"number":"1.0.10","date":"2015-04-29T23:01:57.243Z"},{"number":"1.0.11","date":"2015-04-29T23:27:24.562Z"},{"number":"1.0.12","date":"2015-04-29T23:32:38.162Z"},{"number":"1.0.13","date":"2015-04-29T23:34:49.918Z"},{"number":"1.0.14","date":"2015-04-29T23:36:15.386Z"},{"number":"1.0.15","date":"2015-04-29T23:37:46.006Z"},{"number":"1.0.16","date":"2015-04-30T07:14:18.417Z"},{"number":"1.0.17","date":"2015-04-30T19:35:24.271Z"},{"number":"1.0.19","date":"2015-04-30T20:26:20.339Z"},{"number":"1.0.20","date":"2015-05-01T01:18:41.369Z"},{"number":"0.0.1-security","date":"2016-09-30T20:55:32.529Z"},{"number":"2.0.0","date":"2017-01-27T01:32:18.232Z"},{"number":"2.0.1","date":"2017-01-27T01:48:51.374Z"},{"number":"2.1.0","date":"2017-02-01T00:43:03.241Z"},{"number":"2.1.1","date":"2017-02-04T00:57:25.179Z"},{"number":"2.1.2","date":"2017-02-10T01:49:47.450Z"}],"created":"2015-04-26T20:18:02.370Z","modified":"2017-02-10T01:49:47.450Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"nickclaw","email":"nickclaw@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"nickclaw","email":"nickclaw@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"dev-proxy","_nodeVersion":"6.8.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/dev-proxy-2.1.2.tgz_1486691387223_0.6394220420625061"},"_npmUser":{"name":"nickclaw","email":"nickclaw@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.0.2","_rev":"7-931c5b7636aa17f98220bf2685f29d61","_shasum":"d987cc61db87f6fe17f63657ab71dad5852b8027","author":"","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nickclaw/dev-proxy/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.1.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"d987cc61db87f6fe17f63657ab71dad5852b8027","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/dev-proxy/-/dev-proxy-2.1.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"nickclaw","email":"nickclaw@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-02-10T01:49:47.450Z","created":"2015-04-26T20:18:02.370Z","1.0.0":"2015-04-26T20:18:02.370Z","1.0.1":"2015-04-29T04:38:05.501Z","1.0.2":"2015-04-29T04:53:01.201Z","1.0.3":"2015-04-29T05:08:06.553Z","1.0.4":"2015-04-29T05:11:17.382Z","1.0.5":"2015-04-29T05:15:22.233Z","1.0.6":"2015-04-29T05:20:39.484Z","1.0.7":"2015-04-29T05:23:11.092Z","1.0.8":"2015-04-29T05:25:39.718Z","1.0.9":"2015-04-29T05:38:15.437Z","1.0.10":"2015-04-29T23:01:57.243Z","1.0.11":"2015-04-29T23:27:24.562Z","1.0.12":"2015-04-29T23:32:38.162Z","1.0.13":"2015-04-29T23:34:49.918Z","1.0.14":"2015-04-29T23:36:15.386Z","1.0.15":"2015-04-29T23:37:46.006Z","1.0.16":"2015-04-30T07:14:18.417Z","1.0.17":"2015-04-30T19:35:24.271Z","1.0.19":"2015-04-30T20:26:20.339Z","1.0.20":"2015-05-01T01:18:41.369Z","0.0.1-security":"2016-09-30T20:55:32.529Z","2.0.0":"2017-01-27T01:32:18.232Z","2.0.1":"2017-01-27T01:48:51.374Z","2.1.0":"2017-02-01T00:43:03.241Z","2.1.1":"2017-02-04T00:57:25.179Z","2.1.2":"2017-02-10T01:49:47.450Z"}}}
