(Credits to @Troy Cochran)\n* 0.1.5\n - Add support for a show function (Credits to @tekdel)\n* 0.1.4\n - The required minimal version of node is now 0.12\n - Support for the built-in `_sum` and `_count` reduce functions.\n - Now, mock-couch uses **the Views Collation rules** of CouchDB, by using [couch-viewkey-compare](https://github.com/monowerker/couch-viewkey-compare). (Thanks to @monowerker for this module).\n - GET `_uuids` (Credits to @watchforstock)\n - Several fixes (Credits to @monowerkerds and @reederz)\n* 0.1.3\n - Several fixes (Thanks to @monowerker and @alexjeffburke)\n - Rewriting a lot of the code using [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) (to make it more functional)\n - Support for [linked documents](http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Introduction_to_CouchDB_views#Linked_documents) in views (Credits to @monowerker)\n - Implementation of [`_changes`](https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_database_API#Changes) (Credits to @conor-mac-aoidh)\n* 0.1.2\n - Added HEAD requests. (Credits to @davidwood)\n - Added option to prevent keep-alive connections. (Credits to @davidwood)\n - Now is possible to use the query option `key` on views.\n - Other fixes.\n* 0.1.1\n - The emitted events are now standarized. Read about the [events](http://chris-l.github.io/mock-couch/#events) on the documentation.\n* 0.1.0\n - **Support for views** (map and reduce functions). Create a `_design/` document to use them. Read more about them [here](http://chris-l.github.io/mock-couch/#views).\n - Documentation available on http://chris-l.github.io/mock-couch/\n - Added `addDoc` method to add a document from the node.js side. Contrary to adding a document with a PUT, this is sync and allows you to specify the `_rev`\n\n## Documentation\n\nVisit the [Mock Couch website](http://chris-l.github.io/mock-couch/).\n\n## Features\n\n* Implemented with [restify](https://github.com/mcavage/node-restify).\n* Uses simple JavaScript objects as documents.\n* It emit events, so the tests can listen to them.\n* The `mock_couch` object has a `databases` public property, to examine how the databases are in any moment.\n* Several of the CouchDB REST methods. Right now it has:\n - GET one document\n - GET `_all_docs`, including:\n    - `include_docs=true`\n    - `descending=true`\n    - `startkey`\n    - `endkey`\n    - also, using `_all_docs` with POST to specify the desired keys\n - GET the information of a database\n - GET `_all_dbs`\n - GET `_uuids`\n - GET views (like `http://localhost:5984/database/_design/myviews/_view/someview/`)\n - PUT one document\n - PUT a database\n - POST one document\n - POST to `_bulk_docs` multiple documents\n - DELETE one document\n - DELETE a database\n\n## Not yet implemented\n\n* deleting by setting the `_deleted` member\n* Attachment support\n* And a lot of other things!\n\nKeep in mind that Mock Couch is not attempting to fully implement CouchDB, but only the features necessary for unit testing CouchDB based apps.\n\nHowever, if there is a feature you need for your tests, feel free to add a feature request in the [issues section](https://github.com/chris-l/mock-couch/issues)!\n\n## Usage\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```javascript\nvar mockCouch = require('mock-couch');\n\n// myfun is the function that we want to test.\n// It uses couchdb, either by using cradle, nano, or direct http requests\n// This function takes an object as parameter, maybe runs some validations\n// and if everything is ok, then save it on couchdb.\nvar myfun = require('somefunc');\n\n\ndescribe('myfun', function() {\n\n  beforeEach(function() {\n    // Starting the server\n    var couchdb = mockCouch.createServer();\n\n    // Make sure you are either executing this test under a machine that does not have couchdb installed/enabled,\n    // or that you are using a different port!\n    // (which may require that you are able to specify the couchdb port on the function you are about to test)\n    couchdb.listen(5984);\n\n    // This creates a db for Mock Couch. The db is nothing but an array of objects.\n    // If we provide an object with an _id property, it will use it. Otherwise, it will create a random one.\n    couchdb.addDB('people', [ { name : 'one name', lastname : 'one lastname' }, { _id : '4568797890', name : 'second name', lastname : 'other lastname' } ]);\n  });\n\n\n  // Here is the test\n  it('must add a person to couchdb', function(done) {\n\n    // Now we add a listener that is expecting the data we are about to send.\n    couchdb.on('POST', function(data) {\n      expect(data.doc.name).toBe('reimu');\n      expect(data.doc.lastname).toBe('hakurei');\n      done();\n    });\n\n    // And here we are finally calling the function\n    myfun({ name : 'reimu', lastname : 'hakurei' });\n\n  });\n});\n```\n\nIf your testing requires the frequent setup and teardown of the mock server, it may be beneficial to prevent keep-alive connections. The server will always return a `Connection: close` header if constructed with a `keepAlive` option set to `false`.\n\n```\nvar couchdb = mockCouch.createServer({ keepAlive: false });\n```\n\n## Status\n\nIn this moment I think it could be considered beta; I don't expect any breaking changes.\n\n## License\n\nMIT license\n\n## Contribution\n\nYour feedback, pull requests, etc are welcomed! :)\n","created":"2014-04-06T04:32:38.141Z","modified":"2016-07-01T09:53:11.226Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"chris-l","email":"dev@christopher-luna.com"},"owners":[{"name":"chris-l","email":"dev@christopher-luna.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"mock-couch","_nodeVersion":"5.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/mock-couch-0.1.8.tgz_1467366789336_0.061713373055681586"},"_npmUser":{"name":"chris-l","email":"dev@christopher-luna.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.7.3","_rev":"1-e8bd394db48a5d3e8591dc5f5dcf3d6a","_shasum":"d87ae18e8d1caa28f0238b013e27c476d5183b31","author":{"name":"Christopher Luna","email":"dev@christopher-luna.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chris-l/mock-couch/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.8"},"dist":{"shasum":"d87ae18e8d1caa28f0238b013e27c476d5183b31","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/mock-couch/-/mock-couch-0.1.8.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"chris-l","email":"dev@christopher-luna.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-07-01T09:53:11.226Z","created":"2014-04-06T04:32:38.141Z","0.0.1":"2014-04-06T04:32:38.141Z","0.0.2":"2014-04-09T07:06:12.953Z","0.0.3":"2014-04-12T18:24:51.226Z","0.0.4":"2014-04-13T00:39:59.959Z","0.0.5":"2014-04-14T20:24:26.707Z","0.0.6":"2014-04-17T20:07:50.824Z","0.0.7":"2014-04-18T05:29:05.073Z","0.0.8":"2014-04-20T07:25:50.148Z","0.1.0":"2014-05-11T22:16:04.798Z","0.1.1":"2014-05-12T04:37:33.094Z","0.1.2":"2014-06-09T18:49:18.594Z","0.1.3":"2015-04-27T00:07:15.368Z","0.1.4":"2015-07-24T01:00:48.882Z","0.1.6":"2015-12-15T01:58:20.010Z","0.1.7":"2016-06-27T07:47:53.724Z","0.1.8":"2016-07-01T09:53:11.226Z"}}}
