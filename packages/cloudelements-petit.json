'Tightrope', a.k.a. 'Elements\nConnect'), which is used to allow a private backend service to expose\nitself to the Cloud Elements product.\n\nDocumentation on the Ground2Cloud configuration file, by default\n`~/.petit/config.toml` can be found [here](./doc/config.md). You can use\nthe `petit-client init` or `petit-server init` (see below) to create\nthis file.\n\n### Background\n\nMost CE elements connect to \"backend services\" to operate. These\ncustomer-run services are either publically available via the internet, or\nco-located on the same private cloud deployment. However, some customers\nrightly wish to allow CE to access their services, while they want or\nneed more stringent restrictions on everyone else. This is especially\ntrue when the services in question are located on end-user personal or\nbusiness computers, and are generally not hosted environments.\n\nIn the past, the options for these customers were limited to:\n\n* keeping an up-to-date IP-based access whitelist\n* installing a full CE private cloud deployment\n* maintaining some sort of expensive and/or intrusive VPN setup\n\nThe Cloud Elements On-Prem Connector was created to solve this problem;\nit allows individual service providers to quickly and easily expose\ntheir service (and only their service) to elements that are located\non the public cloud.\n\n### How It Works\n\nThe Cloud Elements On-Prem Connector comes in two parts: a server that\nruns on the CE public cloud, and a client that runs on the backend\nservice machine or subnet. The client application registers itself with\nthe server, and then opens a reverse proxy tunnel from the server\nmachine to its host environment. As long as the client is running,\npublic elements on the server environment will be able to access the\ntarget service on the client machine as if they were co-located.\n\nCommunication along the tunnel is protected by a TLS layer, so all\nchatter between the endpoints is secured. The connector implements a\nrobust protocol for registration and selection, so all clients connect\nto all elements--and only those elements--which are destined for that\ncustomer.\n\n### Installation and Maintenance\n\nThe Cloud Elements On-Prem Connector is executed and distributed using\nthe [Node.js runtime environment](https://nodejs.org/en/ \"Node\"). To\nexpose a customer service, you will need to download and install Node on\nthe client machine. Once Node is installed, you can use the \"Node\nPackage Manager\" (npm) to install the On-Prep Connector package. Run the\nfollowing command with root or administrator privilege:\n\n    # npm install -g cloudelements-petit\n\nYou can keep the client up-to-date at any time using npm as well:\n\n    # npm update -g cloudelements-petit\n\n#### Installation with Docker\n\nYou can use docker to create a node-based container, without having node\ninstalled on the host.\n\n    $ docker-compose build && docker-compose up\n\nCurrently, when using Ctrl-C to exit docker-compose, it does not\nshutdown cleanly, leaving a lock file in the container. If this happens,\nyou need to run `$ docker-compose up --force-recreate` to start up the\nserver again.\n\nTo avoid this issue entirely, don't use Ctrl-C to exit docker-compose;\ninstead, issue a STOP command to the server:\n\n    $ echo -ne \"STOP\\x03\" | nc <host> 3016\n\nOn linux, `host` is the actual host machine (i.e. `localhost`). When\nrunning on a MacOS, the host is the VirtualBox machine on which the\nDocker service runs. It's usually something like `192.168.99.100`. Run\n`docker-machine ls` to find the actual IP.\n\n### Running the Client\n\nOnce installed, you can run `petit-client` commands to control the\nclient process. For example, you can initialize the client like this\n(you don't need administrator privilege to run petit-client commands):\n\n    $ petit-client init\n\nThis command creates a default `~/.petit/config.toml` configuration file\nin your home directory. You can edit the config file at this point to\nsuit your needs: read more about the config file [here](./doc/config.md).\n\nOnce the configuration is to your liking, you can register with the\nserver:\n\n    $ petit-client register\n\nAnd then start:\n\n    $ petit-client start\n\n`start` will open the connection between your service and the public\nelements that use it. If you need to restart the machine where the\nConnector is running, be sure to start the Connector again.\n\nSome other commands that you may find useful:\n\n    $ petit-client stop         # shutdown the connector\n    $ petit-client status       # output the connector status\n    $ petit-client unregister   # unregister from the server\n    $ petit-client config       # show the current configuration\n    $ petit-client sping        # to test server communication\n\n","created":"2016-01-14T17:33:56.310Z","modified":"2016-10-12T01:36:48.829Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"chaaz","email":"ozchaz@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"chaaz","email":"ozchaz@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"cloudelements-petit","_nodeVersion":"4.3.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/cloudelements-petit-0.5.7.tgz_1476236208156_0.8821176935452968"},"_npmUser":{"name":"chaaz","email":"ozchaz@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.9.5","_rev":"1-634aa2c70546e779776f6ba242881c3e","_shasum":"2a364f87e5310230c0bc4a48d9e29112cc86c8da","author":{"name":"Charlie Ozinga"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/cloud-elements/petit/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.7"},"dist":{"shasum":"2a364f87e5310230c0bc4a48d9e29112cc86c8da","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/cloudelements-petit/-/cloudelements-petit-0.5.7.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"chaaz","email":"ozchaz@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-10-12T01:36:48.829Z","created":"2016-01-14T17:33:56.310Z","0.1.0":"2016-01-14T17:33:56.310Z","0.1.1":"2016-01-18T18:59:38.891Z","0.1.2":"2016-01-18T19:07:00.062Z","0.1.3":"2016-01-18T19:12:26.770Z","0.1.4":"2016-01-18T19:22:27.598Z","0.1.5":"2016-01-19T01:55:08.181Z","0.1.6":"2016-01-19T19:08:51.724Z","0.1.9":"2016-01-27T08:02:17.061Z","0.1.12":"2016-04-19T19:24:56.334Z","0.1.13":"2016-04-20T21:57:04.862Z","0.5.2":"2016-06-22T17:42:48.113Z","0.5.4":"2016-08-15T21:09:03.496Z","0.5.5":"2016-09-01T11:19:57.008Z","0.5.6":"2016-09-30T01:20:57.032Z","0.5.7":"2016-10-12T01:36:48.829Z"}}}
