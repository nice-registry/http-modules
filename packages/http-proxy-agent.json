An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent)\n\nThis module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified\nHTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http` module.\n\n__Note:__ For HTTP proxy usage with the `https` module, check out\n[`node-https-proxy-agent`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install http-proxy-agent\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n``` js\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar HttpProxyAgent = require('http-proxy-agent');\n\n// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nconsole.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);\nvar opts = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `HttpProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\nvar agent = new HttpProxyAgent(proxy);\nopts.agent = agent;\n\nhttp.get(opts, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to
