Be sure to include an appropriate protocol (ie. http://, https://, etc)\n    * `HTTP_METHOD` - The HTTP Method that will be used to make this call (ie. GET, POST, DELETE, etc)\n    * `REQ_BODY` - This is a `key: value` JSON document that will allow you to pass data in the body of the requests.\n    * `REQ_HEADERS` - This is a `key: value` JSON document that will allow you to pass data in the headers of the requests.\n    * `NUM_PASSES` - The number of times that you wish to run the multiple requests.  Each pass is run in series and will asynchronously make `NUM_REQUESTS` requests to the given web address.\n    * `NUM_REQUESTS` - The number of HTTP requests to make asynchronously in each pass.\n\n* Once the options have been configured, run:\n```bash\nnode perfTest.js\n```\n\n## Sample Output\n\n```\nStarting the performance test...\n\nPerforming singleRequest for baseline...\nFinished singleRequest.\n  Request took: 148 ms.\n\n\nStarting pass #0\n  Response Times (ms): 144, 155, 145, 144, 134, 223, 220, 248, 250, 249, 307, 319, 352, 352, 347\n  Response Calculations:  { sum: 3589, average: 239.26666666666668 }\n\n\nStarting pass #1\n  Response Times (ms): 141, 150, 127, 128, 129, 217, 215, 228, 237, 247, 287, 302, 322, 334, 342\n  Response Calculations:  { sum: 3406, average: 227.06666666666666 }\n\n\nStarting pass #2\n  Response Times (ms): 131, 127, 126, 161, 159, 217, 455, 228, 245, 255, 304, 319, 318, 332, 335\n  Response Calculations:  { sum: 3712, average: 247.46666666666667 }\n\n\nStarting pass #3\n  Response Times (ms): 150, 147, 157, 143, 126, 224, 249, 243, 259, 242, 312, 343, 340, 351, 352\n  Response Calculations:  { sum: 3638, average: 242.53333333333333 }\n\n\nStarting pass #4\n  Response Times (ms): 148, 158, 156, 158, 169, 222, 255, 252, 252, 254, 331, 350, 350, 351, 351\n  Response Calculations:  { sum: 3757, average: 250.46666666666667 }\n\n\nAverage Response Time: 241.43333333333334 ms\n\n\nAll passes have been completed.\nFinished the performance test.\n```\n\n## Features\n* Provides a baseline for a single request\n* Allows you to see how your app/web service/endpoint scales with multiple requests asynchronously\n* Provides summary information\n* Passes applicable information back to init method's callback\n\n## TODO\n* Convert to node module to allow for easier testing\n* Pass more applicable data back to the user\n","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2014-05-08T16:26:52.511Z"},{"number":"0.0.2","date":"2014-05-08T16:28:23.529Z"},{"number":"0.0.6","date":"2016-04-27T03:00:43.582Z"}],"starsCount":1,"created":"2014-05-08T16:26:52.511Z","modified":"2016-04-27T03:00:43.582Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mrodrig","email":"rodrigues.mi@husky.neu.edu"},"owners":[{"name":"mrodrig","email":"rodrigues.mi@husky.neu.edu"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-performance","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/node-performance-0.0.6.tgz_1461726042544_0.19094665488228202"},"_npmUser":{"name":"mrodrig","email":"rodrigues.mi@husky.neu.edu"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_rev":"1-e6339f191910cc07c059134d3d953c37","_shasum":"f6d5ccb2659d023947d8137d36c45f955bb6591e","author":{"name":"mrodrig"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mrodrig/node-performance/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"f6d5ccb2659d023947d8137d36c45f955bb6591e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-performance/-/node-performance-0.0.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mrodrig","email":"rodrigues.mi@husky.neu.edu"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-04-27T03:00:43.582Z","created":"2014-05-08T16:26:52.511Z","0.0.1":"2014-05-08T16:26:52.511Z","0.0.2":"2014-05-08T16:28:23.529Z","0.0.6":"2016-04-27T03:00:43.582Z"},"users":{"mrodrig":true}}}
