This is a good example of an over opinionated library that\nis designed to work for the one usecase of testing an http server over\nngrok based on it's ngrok url.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar ngrokify = require('ngrok-my-server');\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n// ... do stuff with app\n\n\n// lanch the app if it's not running already (you can also pass a\n// plain http server) and get a ngrok url for it...\nngrokify(app).then(function(url) {\n  // yey ngrok url now you can use it with http.get or something to run\n  // tests locally.\n});\n```\n\n## Why?\n\nMy primary use case is to use this in combination with my\n[testing-github](https://github.com/lightsofapollo/testing-github)\nmodule for testing different types of hooks (for end-to-end types of\ntests).\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 James Lal\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
