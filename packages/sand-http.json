HTTP Application Server Grain for Sand.js\n\nThis grain provides a full HTTP Application Server SDK. Features include \n\n- Automatic server lifecycle management\n- Regular Expression based routing\n- Request Middleware Ã  la [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/)\n- MVC style controllers and views\n- A unique execution context for each web request\n- Graceful error handling per request\n- Other sand grains can extend the web server's functionality through `bindToContext`. (TODO expand on this)\n- Supports (and encourages) usage of EcmaScript 6 syntactic goodness\n- Battle tested in at least two production applications [Whym](https://getwhym.com) and [Blackfriday.fm](https://www.blackfriday.fm)\n- Automatic image size generation.\n- And much more!\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install --save sand-http`\n\n## Components\n\nBelow is listed the basic project structure for an HTTP Application Server.\n\n- `config/routes.js` contains the mapping of url patterns to controller/actions\n- `config/http.js` contains the basic config for the server.\n- `controllers/` contains the controllers where the server application logic is implemented.\n- `views/` contains the views and layouts used to be rendered in the application.\n- `views/layout/` contains the view layouts to be used in rendering views.\n- `public/` hosted as static files. (i.e. CSS, JS, other static files)\n- `app.js` to load the grain of course.\n\n\n### Routes\n\nRoutes are exported as an object of Regular Expression properties and Controller/action combinations.\n\nProperties are [XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/) compatible strings.\nValues are `.` separated strings of the form `'ControllerName.actionName'`.\n\n- Named properties are supported in route patterns. For example `'/users/(?<userId>\\\\d+)'`\n- Note that shortcut character classes such as `\\d`, `\\w`, etc must be double escaped like `\\\\d`, `\\\\w`, etc.\n\n### Controllers and Actions\n\nA controller, the C of Model-View-Controller, is a class that extends `require('sand-http').Controller`.\n\nAn action is a _static Generator Function_ member of a controller that executes a piece of application logic.\n\nAll actions provide `this.req` and `this.res`: references to the HTTP request and response objects associated with the request.\n\n## Usage\n\nHere is a sample project.\n\n`app.js`\n\n```JavaScript\n\"use strict\";\n\nconst Http = require('sand-http');\nconst Sand = require('sand');\n\nlet app = new Sand({log: '*'});\napp.use(Http);\napp.start();\n```\n\n`config/routes.js`\n\n```JavaScript\nmodule.exports = {\n\t'/': 'MyController.index'\n};\n```\n\n`config/http.js`\n\n```JavaScript\nmodule.exports = {\n\tall: {\n\t\tport: 3000\n\t}\n};\n```\n\n`controllers/MyController.js`\n\n```JavaScript\n\"use strict\";\n\nconst Helper = require('../classes/Helper');\n\nconst Controller = require('sand-http').Controller;\n\nclass MyController extends Controller {\n\n\t/*\n\tThis is a controller action.\n\t\n\tNote that all controller actions are static Generator Functions.\n\t\n\tThe `this` reference within the action is called a `Context` object. Sand.js provides `Context` objects. `Context` objects allow tracking a single line of execution. If you are familiar with PHP, their \"scope\" is similar to that of `$_GET`, etc.\t\n\tBy design, the `Context` object may be referenced by `sand.ctx` from anywhere in the application to obtain a reference to the `this` of the currently executing request. This functionality allows Helper classes (for example `Helper`) to obtain a reference to the currently executing request WITHOUT having to pass the `req` object as an argument or call the Helper functions with `req` bound as `this`.\n\t*/\n\tstatic *index() {\n\n\t\t// this.req.url == Helper.getUrl() is an example of the relationship between `this` and `sand.ctx`.\n\n\t\tlet req = this.req; // Request object (just like express)\n\t\tlet res = this.res; // Response object (just like express)\n\t\treq.pipe(res);\n\t\t\n\t}\n\t\n}\n\nmodule.exports = MyController;\n```\n\n`classes/Helper.js`\n\n```JavaScript\n\"use strict\";\n\n// this is a helper class\nclass Helper {\n\n\tstatic getUrl() {\n\t\treturn sand.ctx.req.url;\n\t}\n\t\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Helper;\n```\n\nAfter creating the above structure, run it as follows\n\n```Bash\nnpm init\n# ...\nnpm install --save sand sand-http\nnode app\n```\n\n## Adaptive Image\n\nIf enabled, this feature will recognize the route `/ai/<width>x<height>(@2x)?/your/path/to/the/static/image.(png|jpe?g|gif)` and will generate and return an image according to the width and height (and optionally @2x) specified. See [config.ai](#config) for specific details on using this feature.\n\nOptions include\n\n- `<width>` - required\n- `<height>` - required\n- `jpeg|png|gif` - required - these are the only supported images currently\n- `@2x` - optional - indicates whether to render the image for retina screens or not\n\n## Config\n\n#### File\n\n`config/http.js`\n\n#### Config Properties\n\n| Property Name | Type | Required | Description |\n| ------------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |\n| port | integer | Yes | Indicates which port to bind when running your HTTP service. (Default: 3000) |\n| view | object |  | Contains details for loading and rendering Views |\n| view.layout | string |  | Contains the name of the layout to use from the `views/layout/` directory. |\n| view.data(ctx) | function |  | A hook called every time a view or layout is rendered. The `ctx` argument indicates the currently executing request `Context`. This function should return an object of properties that will be passed in to the view file at render time. |\n| session | object |  | Contains the details for managing Web Sessions. This option requires [sand-session](https://github.com/SandJS/session) to be included and loaded on the application. Config options are based on [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session). See `express-session` for config details. |\n| ai | object |  | Indicates whether to use [_Adaptive Image_](#adaptive-image). This option _requires_ [gm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gm) module and also requires the [graphics-magick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) OS package to be installed. (Default: uses memory store) |\n| ai.useCache | boolean |  | Indicates whether to cache the individual images generated for each size. (Default: true) |\n| ai.get(cacheKey, callback(err, buffer)) | function |  | A custom getter function for the cache. Use the cache key to check your cache location, and call the given callback with a buffer of the returned image. |\n| ai.put(cacheKey, buffer, callback()) | function |  | A custom putter function for the cache. use the cache key to put the buffer into your cache. Invoke the callback when you're done. |\n| ai.stream(path) | function |  | A custom function for loading a stream of your image file from a remote source (other than the file system). Use path to look up the image on the remote resource and return a stream of the image data. |\n| beforeAllMiddleware(app) | function |  | A synchronous hook called on application init which passes an instance of the `express` server object. This allows you set custom express middleware `app.use(expressMiddleware)` that will be called with your controller actions. |\n| useBodyParser | boolean |  | Indicates whether to load the `bodyParser` config option. |\n| bodyParser | object |  | Contains options to be passed into [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser). See `body-parser` for config details. |\n| onError(err, ctx) | function |  | A callback that receives any request errors. Arguments include the error and the request `Context` that threw the error. You can use this to do custom error reporting (i.e. send an error summary email to the dev who wrote the broken code, etc.). |\n\n## Grain API\n\n#### Global Grain Reference\n\n`sand.http`\n\n#### Properties\n\n| Property Name | Type | Returns | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [config](#config) | object |  | The reference to the HTTP config. You can attach whatever else you want to the HTTP config and use it with `sand.http.config` anywhere in your project. |\n\n## HTTP Context
