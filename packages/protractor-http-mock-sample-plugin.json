In other words, it allows you to extend the rules used to match a request from your application to a provided mock request on your test.\n\n## Creating your own plugin\n\nCreate an NPM module that provides an object with a `match` function:\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\n\t\tmatch: function(mockRequest, requestConfig){\n\n\t\t}\n\t};\n\n`mockRequest` object is the mock currently being checked to see if it matches the actual request your app made.\n\n`requestConfig` is the config object from the request the app made.\n\n`protractor-http-mock` expects a truthy or falsy value to indicate a successfull match or not.\n\n## Note\n\nNote that your plugin code will only execute if all other standard checks pass since it runs at the end of the chain.","created":"2016-04-07T02:01:58.982Z","modified":"2016-04-07T02:01:58.982Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"atecarlos","email":"atecarlos@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"atecarlos","email":"atecarlos@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"protractor-http-mock-sample-plugin","_nodeVersion":"0.12.4","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/protractor-http-mock-sample-plugin-0.0.1.tgz_1459994516754_0.033985734917223454"},"_npmUser":{"name":"atecarlos","email":"atecarlos@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.10.1","_rev":"1-cebce0409f787f28415bf58f2dd0f832","_shasum":"d1fa76f37940d373f154bab48536301a818b3411","author":{"name":"Carlos Atencio"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atecarlos/protractor-http-mock-sample-plugin/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"d1fa76f37940d373f154bab48536301a818b3411","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/protractor-http-mock-sample-plugin/-/protractor-http-mock-sample-plugin-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"atecarlos","email":"atecarlos@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-04-07T02:01:58.982Z","created":"2016-04-07T02:01:58.982Z","0.0.1":"2016-04-07T02:01:58.982Z"}}}
