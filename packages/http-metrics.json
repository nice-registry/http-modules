This includes time_pretransfer and also the time the server needed to calculate the result.\n* `time_total` The total time, in seconds, that the full operation lasted. The time will be displayed with millisecond resolution.\n\n## Installation\n\n> $ npm install http-metrics\n\n## Usage\n\n### request(options, cb)\n\n`options` can be an object or a string.
