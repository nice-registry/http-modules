The module will usually be used with the `POST` method that contains a form with a file upload button.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n$ npm install node-red-contrib-http-multipart\n```\nnode-red should automatically detect the new node upon restarting of the server.\n\n## Usage\nOnce installed, a new `http-multipart` node will be available in your node-red nodes panel. Drag the node onto the flow sheet and use as you would the other http-in node.  Output of the node will be a message which contains the files in a `msg.req.files` object.\n\nTo retrieve the file object, you can add a function node to the out port of the node that reads the msg.req.files object.\n\n## Configuration\nConfiguration of this node is the same as the `node-red-http-in` node with the exception of the `fields` config option.  `fields` refers to the fields in the form that will contain files.\n\nEg. For a form with the following field\n```html\n<input type=\"file\" name=\"myUploadedFile\" />\n```\nthe `fields` section of your node configuration would contain the following:\n```\n[ { \"name\": \"myUploadedFile\"} ]\n```\nThe fields configuration is passed directly to the [Fields](https://github.com/expressjs/multer#fieldsfields) option in the [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) plugin, so you can use any options that would work for multer in the configuration area.\nex:\n```\n[\n  { name: 'avatar', maxCount: 1 },\n  { name: 'gallery', maxCount: 8 }\n]\n```\n#### Example\nWith HTML like the following:\n```html\n...\n<form action=\"/upload\" method=\"POST\">\n    <input type=\"file\" name=\"myFile\" />\n    <input type=\"submit />\n</form>\n...\n```\nYou can upload to a node with the following configuration:\n```javascript\n[{ \"name\": \"myFile\" }]\n```\n\nand access the files using the following function on the out port of the node\n```javascript\nvar fields = msg.req.fields;\nmsg.fields = Object.keys(fields);\nvar myFile = fields[\"myFile\"][0];\nmsg.localFilename = myFile.path\n...\n```\nAll of the available properties of the file object can be found in the [Multer documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer#file-information).\n\nLicense\n----\n\nMIT\n\nCopyright\n----\n\n&copy; 2016 John O'Connor\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2016-04-21T03:47:55.420Z","modified":"2016-09-11T00:27:40.808Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"sax1johno","email":"sax1johno@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"sax1johno","email":"sax1johno@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-red-contrib-http-multipart","_nodeVersion":"4.4.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/node-red-contrib-http-multipart-0.2.0.tgz_1473553658330_0.02895789360627532"},"_npmUser":{"name":"sax1johno","email":"sax1johno@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.6","_rev":"1-205b8a251ae4a33865b7646283bbef89","_shasum":"b62935a89e83e5b14610668456d6d74b3c01cfd1","author":{"name":"John O'Connor","url":"sax1johno@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sax1johno/node-red-contrib-http-multipart/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"b62935a89e83e5b14610668456d6d74b3c01cfd1","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-red-contrib-http-multipart/-/node-red-contrib-http-multipart-0.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"sax1johno","email":"sax1johno@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"Readme.md","time":{"modified":"2016-09-11T00:27:40.808Z","created":"2016-04-21T03:47:55.420Z","0.1.3":"2016-04-21T03:47:55.420Z","0.1.4":"2016-05-09T20:21:49.734Z","0.1.5":"2016-08-17T14:09:56.748Z","0.2.0":"2016-09-11T00:27:40.808Z"},"users":{"roadlabs":true}}}
