It basically allows you to queue callbacks based on HTTP\nmethod and URL.\n\n## Install\n\nThe module is released as ES6 module in the npm registry and can be installed\nusing:\n\n```\nnpm install --save queueback\n```\n\n## API\n\nImport and construct the queue using the following syntax:\n\n```js\nimport Queue from 'queueback';\n\nconst queue = new Queue();\n```\n\n### add\n\nAdd a new callback to a method and URL specific queue. The method accepts the\nfollowing arguments:\n\n- `method` HTTP method\n- `url` URL that is being requested\n- `fn` Callback to queue\n\nThe method will return a boolean that is an indication if we have queue in\nprocess for this callback so no new request should be made.\n\n```js\nif (queue.add('GET', 'http://google.com', fn)) return;\n```\n\nPlease note that we guarantee that the callback is only called once and removed\nfrom the queue after execution.\n\n### remove\n\nRemove an added callback from the queue. The method accepts the following\narguments:\n\n- `method` HTTP method\n- `url` URL that is being requested\n- `fn` Callback to remove\n\n```js\nfunction fn() {\n  throw new Error('I should never be called');\n}\n\nqueue.add('GET', 'https://google.com', fn);\nqueue.remove('GET', 'https://google.com', fn);\nqueue.run('GET', 'https://google.com');\n```\n\n### run\n\nThis allows you to execute all queued callbacks for the given method and URL\ncombination. It accepts the following arguments.\n\n- `method` HTTP method\n- `url` URL that is being requested\n\nAll of the other arguments are passed in to the queued callbacks.\n\n```js\nqueue.run('GET', 'http://google.com', new Error('Failed to load google'));\n```\n\n### all\n\nExecute all the queued callbacks regardless of their method and URL\ncombinations. All arguments are passed in to the queued callbacks.\n\n```js\nqueue.all(new Error('Unable to authenticate with server'));\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","created":"2016-12-28T00:29:45.684Z","modified":"2016-12-28T00:55:39.216Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"},"owners":[{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"queueback","_nodeVersion":"6.2.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/queueback-1.1.0.tgz_1482886538521_0.3303373621311039"},"_npmUser":{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.9.3","_rev":"2-bc75f5c53b042e56cbe6885cade2843c","_shasum":"6432d704230753d9da5537c634b24cf8cf714f8e","author":{"name":"Arnout Kazemier"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/destinythegame/queueback/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"6432d704230753d9da5537c634b24cf8cf714f8e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/queueback/-/queueback-1.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-12-28T00:55:39.216Z","created":"2016-12-28T00:29:45.684Z","1.0.0":"2016-12-28T00:29:45.684Z","1.1.0":"2016-12-28T00:55:39.216Z"}}}
