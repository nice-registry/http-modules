You can change this using the `--speed` (or `-s` alias) option: \n\n    throttle-proxy --speed 50000\n\nOutgoing data is not limited by default. When testing outgoing traffic such as file uploads, the throttling outgoing data stream limited using the `--outgoing` option (again in bytes per second):\n\n\tthrottle-proxy --outgoing 50000\n\nArtificial delay (in ms) can be added to all responses with the `--delay` option:\n\n    throttle-proxy --delay 2000\n\nSpecifying a URL matching string using the `--match` option allows you to simulate latency only for specific assets, for example:\n\n    throttle-proxy --match */app.js\n\nOr only specific assets can be excluded from throttling using the `--skip` option:\n\n    throttle-proxy --skip *.css\n\nFor `--match` and `--skip` the characters `*` and `?` have special meaning in matching pattern.\n`*` = matches up with any combination of characters.\n`?` = matches up with any single character\n\n### Defaults\n\n * port: 3128\n * incoming speed: 100000\n * outgoing speed: unlimited\n * throttle all requests\n * no delay\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2013-04-22T10:08:48.790Z","modified":"2016-03-01T02:12:24.704Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mistakster","email":"mistakster@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mistakster","email":"mistakster@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"throttle-proxy","_nodeVersion":"5.3.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-5-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/throttle-proxy-0.7.0.tgz_1456798342787_0.13164633163250983"},"_npmUser":{"name":"mistakster","email":"mistakster@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.5.2","_rev":"1-1b6e83ec4b6d4ad4e42179fceafcb535","_shasum":"02093001b63b05725ba6eef592d4fe9ddb63246d","author":{"name":"Vladimir Kuznetsov","email":"mistakster@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mistakster/throttle-proxy/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.7.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"02093001b63b05725ba6eef592d4fe9ddb63246d","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/throttle-proxy/-/throttle-proxy-0.7.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mistakster","email":"mistakster@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-03-01T02:12:24.704Z","created":"2013-04-22T10:08:48.790Z","0.1.0":"2013-04-22T10:08:54.092Z","0.1.1":"2013-04-22T10:17:10.029Z","0.2.0":"2013-04-24T05:27:53.677Z","0.2.1":"2013-07-31T02:32:14.070Z","0.3.0":"2013-08-08T05:06:20.543Z","0.4.1":"2013-10-04T06:34:06.434Z","0.4.2":"2013-12-18T02:00:48.414Z","0.5.0":"2015-09-24T02:38:35.854Z","0.6.0":"2015-12-17T03:33:40.883Z","0.7.0":"2016-03-01T02:12:24.704Z"},"users":{"timdp":true}}}
