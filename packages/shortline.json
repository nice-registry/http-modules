Pushes them into the Queue and Storage.  Receivers must register their Pusher before requests will be processed.  Requests that don't have a corresponding receiver will be ignored.\n\n## Pusher\nPulls requests off the Queue and pushes them to their processors.  Only deletes a request from the Queue after callback calls done().\n\n## Queue\nAdd and remove request, can be reset from Storage given a timestamp.\n\n## Storage\nPermanent storage of requests and jobs. Requests indexed by time_created. Deleted after a month.\n\n## Job\nManages a job lifecycle.  Registers a Receiver and a Pusher to a Queue.  Handles errors for Receiver, Pusher, and Queue.\n\n## JobBoard\nlist of available Jobs, keyed by domain.  Allows for run-time configuration changes to job processing.\n\n## CLI Interface\nList, Create, Update and Delete running Jobs via the JobBoard","versions":[{"number":"0.1.6","date":"2012-04-10T20:02:48.807Z"},{"number":"0.2.0","date":"2012-04-10T20:38:08.677Z"},{"number":"0.2.1","date":"2012-10-02T03:17:08.702Z"}],"created":"2012-04-10T20:02:44.846Z","modified":"2012-10-02T03:17:08.702Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"hainish","email":"bill.budington@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"tedsuo","email":"ted@radicaldesigns.org"},{"name":"Hainish","email":"bill.budington@gmail.com"},{"name":"hainish","email":"bill.budington@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"shortline","_npmUser":{"name":"hainish","email":"bill.budington@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.61","_rev":"1-b5f72976fa004f212967e156ce3a4748","author":{"name":"tedsuo,Hainish"},"directories":{"lib":"./lib","bin":"./bin"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"cfe1b5680b688045f1aa2cb7627095b96386654d","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/shortline/-/shortline-0.2.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tedsuo","email":"ted@radicaldesigns.org"},{"name":"Hainish","email":"bill.budington@gmail.com"},{"name":"hainish","email":"bill.budington@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2012-10-02T03:17:08.702Z","created":"2012-04-10T20:02:44.846Z","0.1.6":"2012-04-10T20:02:48.807Z","0.2.0":"2012-04-10T20:38:08.677Z","0.2.1":"2012-10-02T03:17:08.702Z"}}}
