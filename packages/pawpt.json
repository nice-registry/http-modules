This means the Pawprint will be created with an access token, so only people who you share the full URL (including access token) with, will be able to access the data. Also, this means the Pawprint won't be indexed by search engines.\n- `-c, --copy` Copies the public share link in the clipboard so it's ready to paste in another app.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis tool is based one a few other open source projects, mostly:\n\n- [curl-trace-parser](https://github.com/apiaryio/curl-trace-parser) Parser for output from Curl --trace option\n- [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) Terminal string styling done right\n- [request](https://github.com/request/request) Simplified HTTP request client.\n\n## License\n\nThis repository is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
