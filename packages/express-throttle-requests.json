(Default between 50ms and 3000ms)\n\n***DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION.***\n\n***THIS TOOL WAS DESIGNED TO SIMULATE SLOW REQUESTS/RESPONSES FROM THE SERVER***\n\n## Usage\n\n### Usage with express app\n```js\n\nvar app = express();\nvar throttle = require('express-throttle-requests');\n\nthrottle(app);\n\n```\n\n### Usage with express router\n```js\n\nvar router = express.Router();\nvar throttle = require('express-throttle-requests');\n\nthrottle(router);\n\n```\n\n### Development environment only example\n```js\n\nvar router = express.Router();\nif(config.env === 'development'){\n  var throttle = require('express-throttle-requests');\n  throttle(router);\n}\n\n```\n\n## Options\n\nBy default the requests will be throttled between 50ms and 3000ms. These values can be overriden.\n\nmin - Minimum time to wait for request\n\nmax - Maximum time to wait for request\n\n```js\n\nvar app = express();\nvar throttle = require('express-throttle-requests');\n\nthrottle(app, {\n  min:1000, //Example showing a minimum of 1000ms (1 second)\n  max:5000 //Example showing a maximum of 5000 (5 seconds)\n});\n\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org) do\n\n```bash\n$ npm install express-throttle-requests --save-dev\n```\n\n## License\n\n(MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 David Boyne\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
