The currently available reporters\nare:\n* 'console' (which takes no further configuration options) \n* 'json', which creates/updates a JSON file that can be used to draw graphs ([see the wiki](https://github.com/hgcummings/hypermeter/wiki/Using-the-JSON-reporter-to-generate-graphs))\n* 'graph', which makes use of [plotly](https://plot.ly/) (see below)\n\nIf no reporters are specified, a single console reporter is used by default.\n\n### checks (optional)\n\nAn object containing check/config pairs. The currently available checks are\n'status' (which takes no further configuration options), and 'time', which takes\nan integer specifying the maximum allowable response time (in milliseconds).\n\n### client (optional)\n\nSettings for the HTTP client. If any settings are specified then hypermeter uses\n[curlrequest](https://github.com/chriso/curlrequest) and passes your settings\nthrough to cURL. Otherwise, the native node HTTP module is used.\n\nNote that cURL is generally slower than a native HTTP call, so timings won't be\nconsistent between the two.\n\n### Examples\n\nA minimal config file might look like the following:\n\n```\n{\n    \"urls\": [\n        \"https://twitter.com\",\n        \"https://google.com\",\n        \"https://facebook.com\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nA more advanced config file using the graph reporter might look like the following:\n\n```\n{\n    \"urls\": [\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"reporters\": {\n        \"console\": null,\n        \"graph\": {\n            \"username\": \"my_plotly_username\",\n            \"apiKey\": \"my_plotly_api_key\",\n            \"build\": \"$BUILD_NUMBER\",\n            \"filename\": \"plotly_filename\",\n            \"fileId\": \"56\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"checks\": {\n        \"status\": null,\n        \"time\": 5000\n    }\n    \"client\": {\n        \"cert\": \"/etc/pki/my_cert.pem\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that config values can be environment variables (prefixed by `$`).\n\nIf the graph reporter is used with no `fileId` specified, the filename will be\ncreated (or overwritten!) and the URL of the file will be output to the console.\nYou can take the ID from this and add it to your config file for subsequent runs.\n","created":"2014-11-24T20:03:44.378Z","modified":"2015-02-17T09:23:37.756Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"hgcummings","email":"npmjs@hgc.io"},"owners":[{"name":"hgcummings","email":"npmjs@hgc.io"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":"./","_id":"hypermeter","_npmUser":{"name":"hgcummings","email":"npmjs@hgc.io"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_rev":"1-f972e5eb1ec08d141b814bad32425293","_shasum":"b5a96c6e8045c442a5e1d5575911ad37ef8d3148","author":{"name":"hgcummings"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hgcummings/hypermeter/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"b5a96c6e8045c442a5e1d5575911ad37ef8d3148","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hypermeter/-/hypermeter-0.3.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"hgcummings","email":"npmjs@hgc.io"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-02-17T09:23:37.756Z","created":"2014-11-24T20:03:44.378Z","0.0.1":"2014-11-24T20:03:44.378Z","0.0.2":"2014-11-24T20:06:12.750Z","0.0.3":"2014-11-24T20:07:50.024Z","0.0.4":"2014-11-24T20:47:46.749Z","0.0.5":"2014-11-24T21:29:44.759Z","0.1.0":"2015-02-12T16:15:30.297Z","0.1.1":"2015-02-12T16:54:47.438Z","0.1.2":"2015-02-12T16:57:41.563Z","0.1.3":"2015-02-12T16:59:34.757Z","0.2.0":"2015-02-12T23:20:32.532Z","0.3.0":"2015-02-16T09:36:04.217Z","0.3.1":"2015-02-17T09:23:37.756Z"}}}
