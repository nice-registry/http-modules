With this application, those requests can be pointed somewhere temporarily and provide real responses without the hassle of writing stubs.\n\n\n## Available Endpoints\n\n- **`/delay/[time]`** - A `200` response that is delayed by `[time]` seconds.\n- **`/echo/[status]`** - A response of `[status]` status code with no content.  Prints request body to the console.\n- **`/status/[status]`** - A response of `[status]` status code with no content.\n- **`/wildcard/[percentage]`** - A response which randomly fails roughly `[percentage]` percent of the time.\n- **`/[*]`** - Catch-all responder.  Will recognize two custom headers:\n    + **`x-delay`** - Delays response by given integer.\n    + **`x-status`** - Response will return with given status code (1xx - 5xx).\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nnpm install rest-stub\nnpm start\n```\n\nThe application runs on port `48200`.\n\nOn OS X, a launch agent is included (if a little clunky to use):\n\n1. Edit the `com.mikattack.rest-stub.plist` file and change the `/PATH/TO/server.js` string to point to where `rest-stub` was placed.\n2. Copy `com.mikattack.rest-stub.plist` to `~/Library/LaunchAgents`.\n3. Run `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mikattack.rest-stub.plist`\n\nCheck the *Console* application's output if the server doesn't seem accessible.\n","created":"2014-11-06T12:55:39.164Z","modified":"2014-11-06T12:55:39.164Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mikattack","email":"mikattack@users.noreply.github.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mikattack","email":"mikattack@users.noreply.github.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"rest-stub","_npmUser":{"name":"mikattack","email":"mikattack@users.noreply.github.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.10","_rev":"1-ad0da5eaf320d406d26cb7b9f1c7e756","_shasum":"cf87febbfc1c1b7a7d0118a9735abf7b2ed6dd8b","author":{"name":"Alex Mikitik"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mikattack/node-rest-stub/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"cf87febbfc1c1b7a7d0118a9735abf7b2ed6dd8b","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/rest-stub/-/rest-stub-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mikattack","email":"mikattack@users.noreply.github.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-11-06T12:55:39.164Z","created":"2014-11-06T12:55:39.164Z","1.0.0":"2014-11-06T12:55:39.164Z"}}}
