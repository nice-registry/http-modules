It allows you to vary:\n\n* the upload and download speed of requests.\n* the maximum number of concurrent outbound HTTP connections.\n* the number of bytes dropped during transfers.\n\n[Contribute to Crapify on GitHub](https://github.com/bcoe/crapify)\n\n## Usage\n\n* `npm install crapify -g`\n* `crapify --port=5000 --speed=3000 --concurrency=2`, where:\n  * `port` is the port crapify should start on.\n  * `speed` is the connection speed in bytes/second.\n  * `concurrency` is the number of concurrent outbound connections allowed.\n  * `drop-frequency` how often should bytes be dropped? (`byte count` % `drop frequency`).\n\n## Examples\n\n### usage with npm\n\n`npm config set proxy http://127.0.0.1:5000`\n\n### usage with curl\n\n`curl -v --proxy http://127.0.0.1:5000 https://www.google.com`\n\n### usage with OSX\n\n1. Go to `system preferences`.\n2. Click on `Network`.\n3. Click on `Advanced`.\n4. Click on `Proxies`.\n5. Enable an `http`, and an `https` proxy, with `127.0.0.1`, and `:5000`, respectively.\n\n## If you like crapify, you may also like...\n\n- [tylertreat/Comcast](https://github.com/tylertreat/Comcast), a Go frontend that simulates terrible network connections by directly modifying settings for your network interfaces.\n","starsCount":13,"created":"2015-01-03T20:23:07.444Z","modified":"2017-05-22T09:52:32.703Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"bcoe","email":"bencoe@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"email":"ben@npmjs.com","name":"bcoe"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"crapify","_nodeVersion":"0.10.26","_npmUser":{"name":"bcoe","email":"bencoe@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.2.0","_rev":"3-65a89afb6fb75943b038658488ed3541","_shasum":"92f1e884920a508900f6374b5c3a661a896b8cbb","author":{"name":"Ben Coe","email":"ben@npmjs.com"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"92f1e884920a508900f6374b5c3a661a896b8cbb","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/crapify/-/crapify-1.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"ben@npmjs.com","name":"bcoe"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-22T09:52:32.703Z","created":"2015-01-03T20:23:07.444Z","1.0.0":"2015-01-03T20:23:07.444Z","1.0.1":"2015-01-03T20:33:52.109Z","1.0.2":"2015-01-03T20:53:34.684Z","1.0.3":"2015-01-03T20:58:59.062Z","1.0.4":"2015-01-04T00:32:40.447Z","1.1.0":"2015-01-04T03:40:43.443Z","1.1.1":"2015-01-04T17:47:08.598Z","1.1.2":"2015-01-04T19:14:40.524Z","1.2.0":"2015-01-13T01:14:53.718Z"},"users":{"nicolsc":true,"ncw000":true,"edusig":true,"toogle":true,"konklone":true,"line-o":true,"bcoe":true,"skozz":true,"maxidr":true,"mgwalker":true,"brandonb927":true,"ronin161":true,"thorn0":true}}}
