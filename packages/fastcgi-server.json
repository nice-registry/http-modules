If http module changes on the future, probably fastcgi-server will not be considering this changes.\n","versions":[{"number":"0.0.2","date":"2013-11-07T18:24:12.570Z"},{"number":"0.0.3","date":"2013-11-07T18:28:53.655Z"},{"number":"0.0.4","date":"2013-11-08T15:21:17.769Z"},{"number":"0.0.5","date":"2013-11-09T00:49:00.983Z"}],"starsCount":2,"created":"2013-11-07T18:24:10.008Z","modified":"2013-11-09T00:49:00.983Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"doliveira","email":"d.oliveira@prozone.org"},"owners":[{"name":"doliveira","email":"d.oliveira@prozone.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"fastcgi-server","_npmUser":{"name":"doliveira","email":"d.oliveira@prozone.org"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.8","_rev":"1-9f716459846f9752bd8ea7bee9d47cab","author":{"name":"David Oliveira","email":"d.oliveira@prozone.org"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/davidfoliveira/node-fastcgi-server/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.5"},"dist":{"shasum":"4a163699cb6374e908a8dace6c758adf2571084c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/fastcgi-server/-/fastcgi-server-0.0.5.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"doliveira","email":"d.oliveira@prozone.org"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-11-09T00:49:00.983Z","created":"2013-11-07T18:24:10.008Z","0.0.2":"2013-11-07T18:24:12.570Z","0.0.3":"2013-11-07T18:28:53.655Z","0.0.4":"2013-11-08T15:21:17.769Z","0.0.5":"2013-11-09T00:49:00.983Z"},"users":{"doliveira":true,"ricmalta":true}}}
