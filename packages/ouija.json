It'll make your automated requests look\n*more* human!\n\n## Requirements\n\n[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) must be\n[installed](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) and available in the `PATH`.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install ouija\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce the server is up and running, simply issue requests to it like you would\nto any other proxy server. This means providing the host when requesting the\nresource, e.g.:\n\n > GET http://example.com/foo/bar.html\n\n...instead of:\n\n > GET /foo/bar.html\n\n### Special HTTP Headers\n\nOuija accepts some special HTTP headers for manipulating the response or\nconfiguring the resulting request. As usual, the header names are\ncase-insensitive.\n\n - **Ouija-Get-Unmodified-Content**: Normally, if scripts on the page modify\n   the DOM of the requested page, Ouija will return the modified source.\n   Passing this header will ensure you recieve the unmodified source. The value\n   of the header is inconsequential; Ouija only checks for its presence.\n\n - **Ouija-Pass-***: Any headers prefixed with *Ouija-Pass-* will be used in\n   the resulting request (with *Ouija-Pass-* stripped from the name). E.g.,\n   passing:\n\n    > Ouija-Pass-User-Agent: Ouijabot\n\n   ...will result in the following header in the resulting request:\n\n    > User-Agent: Ouijabot\n\n## Author\n\n± ryan (ryan@2-si.de).\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Ryan Ettipio\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
