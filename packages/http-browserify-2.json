Currently, the functions [`request`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback) and [`get`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_get_options_callback) are implemented.\n\n```javascript\nconst req = http.request({\n  method: 'GET',\n  hostname: 'www.thenativeweb.io',\n  port: 80,\n  path: '/'\n}, res => {\n  // Use the response stream and its properties, such as statusCode.\n});\n\nreq.end();\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can access the [`STATUS_CODES`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_status_codes) property to get a map of status codes to human readable messages.\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(http.STATUS_CODES[200]); // => 'OK'\n```\n\nFor further details on how to use these functions see their documentation.\n\n### Supported browsers\n\nThe module was successfully tested with the help of [zuul](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul) and [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) in the latest versions of following browsers:\n\n- Chrome 56\n- Firefox 51\n- Safari 10\n- Edge 14\n- Internet Explorer 10, 11\n- iOS 10\n- Android 5.1\n\n## Running the build\n\nTo build this module use [roboter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roboter).\n\n```bash\n$ bot\n```\n\nTo run browser tests install [zuul](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zuul) globally.\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -g zuul\n```\n\nThen, run browser tests locally.\n\n```bash\n$ bot test-browser\n```\n\nTo run the browser tests on multiple browsers, use the `test-browsers` task.\n\n```bash\n$ bot test-browsers\n```\n\nPlease note that for this you need a [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) account. Additionally, you need to [configure zuul](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/wiki/Cloud-testing) to be able to access the account automatically.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017 the native web.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
