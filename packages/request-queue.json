Inherits from [TasksQueue](https://github.com/tutukin/tasks-queue).\nIt hides the methods\n`TasksQueue.prototype.pushTask` and `TasksQueue.prototype.unshiftTask`. Use\n`RequestQueue.prototype.pushRequest()` and `RequestQueue.prototype.unshiftRequest()`\nmethods instead.\n\n`RequestQueue` depends on the following modules:\n\n* [request](https://npmjs.org/package/request)\n* [jsdom](https://npmjs.org/package/jsdom)\n\n###setRequestDefaults(requestOptions)\n\nSet default options for the request.\nSee [`request.defaults()`](https://npmjs.org/package/request).\n\n###addScripts(paths)\n\nAdd scripts paths or URLs that are passed to jsdom.env as\n`scripts` option.\n\n###getScripts()\n\nReturn an array of paths added with `addScripts(paths)`.\n\n###pushRequest(requestType,requestOptions)\n###unshiftRequest(requestType,requestOptions)\n###addRequest(where,requestType,requestOptions)\n\nInsert a request to the queue.\n\n`pushRequest(t,o)` is equivalent to `addRequesr('tail',t,o)`.\n`unshiftRequest(t,o)` is equivalent to `addRequesr('head',t,o)`.\n\nIf `where` equals to 'head', `addRequest` prepends the request\nto the head of the queue, otherwise it appends it to the\ntail.\n\n`requestType` is a string, used to distinguish the different\ntypes of requests. Don't use strings that start with double colon\n(\"::type\").\n\n`requestOptions` are passed to\n[request(options,callback)](https://npmjs.org/package/request) that\ndoes the actual http request.\n\n###requestType event\n\nThe `requestType` event is emitted when the response is retrieved\nand the DOM is built. Listeners are called with three arguments:\n\n* Jinn instance (See [tasks-queue](https://github.com/tutukin/tasks-queue))\n* errors (See [jsdom.env](https://npmjs.org/package/jsdom) callback arguments)\n* window (See [jsdom.env](https://npmjs.org/package/jsdom) callback arguments)\n\n#Examples\n\nSee examples directory\n\n#Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using Grunt.\n\n#Release History\n\n* April 1, 2013.
