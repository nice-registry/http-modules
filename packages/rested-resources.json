Conceptually similar to `ngResource`, it\nhandles http requests and URL building to give you simple, consistent logic.\n\nResources automatically generate URLs based on their hierarchy. Requests are managed by [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent)\nand results/errors are handled via Promises.\n\n## Installation\n\n- `npm install rested-resources --save`\n- or for yarn users: `yarn add rested-resources`\n\n## Usage\n\nWhile RESTed Resources works as a client-side library, it's built as an NPM module with the assumption you're using\nwebpack or a related library to compile your application.\n\nExamples below are written with some ES6, which will require babel to transpile.\n\nImport the resource classes:\n\n```js\nimport { IdentifiedResource, ResultsResource } from 'resource';\n```\n\nWhile you can export resource classes directly, you'll likely want to use a factory to help setup relationships.\n\n```js\n-- student.js\nexport default class Student extends IdentifiedResource {}\n\n-- students.js\nexport default class Students extends ResultsResource {}\n\n-- course.js:\nimport Student from './student';\nimport Students from './students';\n\nclass Course extends IdentifiedResource {}\n\nexport function(data) {\n    let resource = new Course(data);\n\n    resource.nest(Student);\n    resource.nest(Students);\n\n    return resource;\n}\n```\n\nYou now have everything needed to interact with these resources.\n\nQuerying for all students in a course:\n\n```js\nvar course = new Course({ courseId: 'history-101' });\n\n// performs: GET /courses/history-101/students\ncourse.students.query().then((results) => {\n    // results will be the resulting JSON\n});\n```\n\nQuery for a specific student's course data:\n\n```js\nvar course = new Course({ courseId: 'history-101' });\nvar student = new course.Student({ studentId: 1234 });\n\n// performs: GET /courses/history-101/students/1234\nstudent.get().then((result) => {\n    // result will be the resulting JSON\n});\n```\n\nCreate a new student record:\n\n```js\nvar student = new Student({ name: 'Kermit' });\n\n// performs: POST /students\nstudent.save().then((result) => {});\n```\n","created":"2016-11-17T17:29:30.848Z","modified":"2016-11-17T17:29:30.848Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"viveleroi","email":"botsko@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"viveleroi","email":"botsko@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"rested-resources","_nodeVersion":"6.1.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/rested-resources-0.1.0.tgz_1479403768870_0.5036828457377851"},"_npmUser":{"name":"viveleroi","email":"botsko@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"1-d06f7318934612e7a21cb2dfece35ed0","_shasum":"d28e8b28903918e49daa1250a607666a3a74f3c7","author":{"name":"viveleroi"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"d28e8b28903918e49daa1250a607666a3a74f3c7","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/rested-resources/-/rested-resources-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"viveleroi","email":"botsko@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-11-17T17:29:30.848Z","created":"2016-11-17T17:29:30.848Z","0.1.0":"2016-11-17T17:29:30.848Z"}}}
