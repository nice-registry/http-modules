Most notably, Micron provides an un-buffered middleware pattern modeled after the `function (req, res, next)` convention and basic extensions to the request and response objects.\n\nThe goal of Micron is to provide as thin a layer as possible on top of the core HTTP API as to reduce boilerplate for many applications, but without adding bloat or destroying desirable features such as streams as in the case of Connect / Express.\n\n### Installation\n```bash\nnpm install micron\n```\n\n### Getting Started\n```js\nvar micron = require('micron');\n\n// Create the server and define the request listener\nvar server = micron.createServer(function (req, res) {\n    res.json(req.headers);\n});\n\n// Add some middleware\nserver.use(function (req, res, next) {\n    req.headers['x-server'] = 'Hello from micron';\n    next();\n});\n\n// Start listening for requests\nserver.listen(8080);\n```","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2014-01-09T05:17:15.773Z"}],"starsCount":1,"created":"2014-01-09T05:17:15.363Z","modified":"2014-01-09T05:17:15.773Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"diy","email":"help@diy.org"},"owners":[{"name":"diy","email":"help@diy.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"micron","_npmUser":{"name":"diy","email":"help@diy.org"},"_npmVersion":"1.2.11","_rev":"1-b663750ee946b254eeb32c376f584c46","author":{"name":"Andrew Sliwinski"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"00c8f40e3cf177d8d9af54a1d5ac27b7325855c2","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/micron/-/micron-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"diy","email":"help@diy.org"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-01-09T05:17:15.773Z","created":"2014-01-09T05:17:15.363Z","0.0.1":"2014-01-09T05:17:15.773Z"},"users":{"knksmith57":true}}}
