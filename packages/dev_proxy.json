It then reads the proxy server URI, target URI, file glob patterns, URL match patterns, and white list configurations from there. Example config files can be found in the 'examples/' directory.\n\nStart Dev Proxy by moving into your project directory and running\n\n    dev_proxy\n\nThat's it! Dev Proxy will create a config file for your project inside `~/.dev_proxy/` with the same name as your project folder. You might want to have a look at the config file to make some changes and restart Dev Proxy if you need to make any.\n\nOnce running, Dev Proxy will cache all HTTP requests (which have been whitelisted) in memory. When you make changes to one of your watched files or folders, Dev Proxy uses your configuration settings to 'bust' the appropriate cached HTTP URLs so those requests will get the latest versions on the next page load.\n\nFor more information, visit the [Dev Proxy home page](http://www.kixx.name/projects/dev_proxy).\n\nCopyright and License\n---------------------\nCopyright: (c) 2014 by Kris Walker <kris@kixx.name> (http://www.kixx.name/)\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all source code is licensed under the MIT license.
