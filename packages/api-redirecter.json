Consequently, you can't use `XmlHttpRequest` in the user's browser. This aims to fix that. This is a simple Node.js app that accepts any and all requests, issues said requests on the caller's behalf, and returns the resulting data. \n\n# Setup\n\nThis app is meant to be run on Heroku. However there's nothing stopping you from running it on something else (in fact, it should be fairly trivial to set it up on whichever machine you want). However, I'm only going to document the Heroku way. \n\nTo use it on Heroku: \n\n1. Clone this repo and push to Heroku.\n2. In the `Config Variables` section, set `DOMAIN` to be whatever you want it to be (i.e. `https://www.thisisfake.com/api`).\n\n## Domain Details\n\nYou must include the protocol (either `http` or `https`). Do not include a trailing slash (i.e. `https://www.thisisfake.com/api` is good; `https://www.thisisfake.com/api/` is bad).\n\n# Return Values\n\nA JSON will be returned in the following format:\n\n* `statusCode` will be how the server responded.\n* `body` will be the body of the response.\n* `headers` will be the headers that the server responded with.\n* `request` will be how this app sent the request. \n\n# Domain Restrictions\n\nDo not use this for anything sensitive. The initial release of this app only allows the user to specify the path on a predetermined domain. Only header-less GET requests are supported. This is done partially to alleviate security concerns. \n\n# License\n\ntl;dr: Apache 2.0 License. \n\nCopyright 2017 Kevin Dong\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.","created":"2017-04-13T02:21:02.184Z","modified":"2017-04-13T02:21:02.184Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"kevindong","email":"dong.kevin1@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"kevindong","email":"dong.kevin1@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"api-redirecter","_nodeVersion":"7.7.4","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/api-redirecter-0.0.1.tgz_1492050061501_0.9985709949396551"},"_npmUser":{"name":"kevindong","email":"dong.kevin1@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.1.2","_rev":"1-3533c4e825b85e83eedc72a8a3071297","_shasum":"98718e58062e4b1f603391c12d92a99a9dd74497","author":{"name":"Kevin Dong"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kevindong/api-redirecter/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"98718e58062e4b1f603391c12d92a99a9dd74497","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/api-redirecter/-/api-redirecter-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"kevindong","email":"dong.kevin1@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-13T02:21:02.184Z","created":"2017-04-13T02:21:02.184Z","0.0.1":"2017-04-13T02:21:02.184Z"}}}
