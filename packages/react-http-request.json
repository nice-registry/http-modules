This object is composed by 3 properties:\n\n|Property   |Description   |\n|---|---|\n|error   |Contains superagent request error, see [this](http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/#error-handling) for more information   |\n|result   |Contains superagent request response, see [this](http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/#response-properties) for more information   |\n|loading   |True or false, indicates if request is loading or is finished    |\n\nThis function will be triggered the first time immediately and second time when request is complete.
