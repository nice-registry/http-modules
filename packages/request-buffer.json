But as your application expands you'll often find that you need to call some asynchronous functions before you begin to work with the request body.\n\n```javascript\n// ...\nauthenticateUser(function(authed) {\n  if(authed) {\n    request.on('data', function(chunk) {\n      // It may be too late to bind at this point\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### The Solution\n\nThe simple solution is to always make sure you bind to the request events before any asynchronous functions are called. But passing the event data around and handling it properly can be difficult, especially when using a framework where the request data may need to be passed around by several methods.\n\nThis is where RequestBuffer comes in handy. RequestBuffer enables you to bind to the data event whenever you need without missing any data.\n\nTODO: Sample Code\n\nTODO: Installation","versions":[{"number":"0.0.0","date":"2012-11-23T05:44:54.194Z"},{"number":"1.0.0","date":"2012-11-25T06:37:10.729Z"},{"number":"1.0.1","date":"2012-11-26T17:00:40.708Z"},{"number":"1.0.2","date":"2013-01-18T20:05:41.386Z"},{"number":"1.0.3","date":"2013-01-18T20:09:35.943Z"}],"created":"2012-11-23T05:44:53.621Z","modified":"2013-01-18T20:09:35.943Z","owners":[{"name":"senico","email":"daniel.stevens@senicolabs.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"request-buffer","_rev":"1-e28e679614272626a75babdd44993d8b","author":{"name":"Daniel Stevens","email":"daniel.stevens@senicolabs.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/senico/node-request-buffer/issues"},"directories":{"lib":"./lib"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"4a8719c425a5e865e185d5504b13f1db4148d684","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/request-buffer/-/request-buffer-1.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"senico","email":"daniel.stevens@senicolabs.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2013-01-18T20:09:35.943Z","created":"2012-11-23T05:44:53.621Z","0.0.0":"2012-11-23T05:44:54.194Z","1.0.0":"2012-11-25T06:37:10.729Z","1.0.1":"2012-11-26T17:00:40.708Z","1.0.2":"2013-01-18T20:05:41.386Z","1.0.3":"2013-01-18T20:09:35.943Z"}}}
