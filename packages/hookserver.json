Hookserver\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh\n# install it as a cli tool\nnpm install -g hookserver\n\n# start the server daemonized and redirect log to ./hookserver.log\n# 6086 is the default port, you can use -p or --port option to override it\nhookserver start -d -l ./hookserver.log\n\n# switch to the examples folder shipped with the package\ncd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/hookserver/examples  \n\n# register a webhook with the name 'hello' \n# that will trigger the bash script found at './hello.sh' to be executed\nhookserver add hook hello ./hello.sh\n\n# register a new security key 'my-test-key' to allow access to the registered webhooks via http requests\nhookserver add key my-test-key\n\n# test it out: send a get request to 'http://localhost:6086/hello?my-test-key'\ncurl \"http://localhost:6086/hello?my-test-key\"\n\n# the output:\n# {\"status\":\"success\",\"result\":\"Hello Webhooks!\\n\"}\n```\n\nFor more information, run `hookserver help` or take a look at [help.md](https://github.com/schwarzkopfb/hookserver/blob/master/help.md).\n\n**Note on permissions:** \nHookserver uses `/var/lib/hookserver` to store hook scripts and security keys.\nUsually only the root user is allowed to make changes in that directory, so probably you'll have to use `sudo`.\nIf `npm` was invoked with root privileges, then it will change the uid to the user account or uid specified by the user config, which defaults to `nobody`. \nSet the `--unsafe-perm` flag to run scripts with root privileges and let Hookserver register its working folders.\n\n```sh\n# so instead of this...\nnpm install -g hookserver\n\n# ...maybe you will have to use this\nsudo npm i -g hookserver --unsafe-perm\n```\n\n## Application data\n\nKeep in mind that registered hooks and security keys will not be deleted if you uninstall or update Hookserver.\nYou have to run `hookserver cleanup` before uninstalling it to remove all the saved application data. \n\n## License\n\n[MIT
