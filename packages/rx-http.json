It also enforces a lot of opinions on your requests. I don't\nexpect it to work for all use-cases. Mostly it serves a very similar need as a\npromise. The benefit gained from using Rx around http calls comes when you\nstart writing requests that need to be repeated many times, or need to be\nchained with other Rx-isms. The Rx semantics allow you to write your programs\nmore declaratively.\n\nThis is one of my attempts at finding how much observables can replace other\nidioms in my code.\n\n## Docs\n\nEach method returns an `Observable` and may emit an event on either the `next`,\n`error`, or `complete` channels.\n\n### `getJson$`\n\n```javascript\nvar rxHttp = require('rx-http');\n\nrxHttp.getJson$('http://example.com/user/1').subscribe(function(obj) {\n  // do something with `obj`\n});\n\nrxHttp.getJson$('http://example.com/user/1').subscribe(\n  function(obj) { /* next */ },\n  function(err) { /* error */ },\n  function() { /* complete */ }\n);\n```\n\n### `postJson$`\n\n```javascript\nrxHttp.postJson$('http://example.com/user', {name: 'jon'}).subscribe(function(obj) {\n  // do something with `obj`\n});\n```\n\n## Tests\n\nThis code is unit tested with mock http calls.\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n","created":"2015-05-30T03:57:03.538Z","modified":"2017-04-26T16:57:03.843Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jondelamotte","email":"jondlm@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"jondelamotte","email":"jondlm@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"rx-http","_nodeVersion":"6.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/rx-http-0.2.0.tgz_1493225821010_0.59453752101399"},"_npmUser":{"name":"jondelamotte","email":"jondlm@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"3-bba6aa8451218cd5efdfb0b85da18eda","_shasum":"f49a1a4ebfd5ce2070f8bba2050681a0d73136fb","author":{"name":"Jon de la Motte","email":"jondlm@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jondlm/rx-http/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"f49a1a4ebfd5ce2070f8bba2050681a0d73136fb","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/rx-http/-/rx-http-0.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jondelamotte","email":"jondlm@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-26T16:57:03.843Z","created":"2015-05-30T03:57:03.538Z","0.0.3":"2015-05-30T03:57:03.538Z","0.1.0":"2016-10-24T16:32:16.291Z","0.2.0":"2017-04-26T16:57:03.843Z"}}}
