This means that it has robust cookie handling, but is not yet available for use in browser builds.\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n    $ npm install --save http-client tough-cookie http-client-cookie-jar\n\nhttp-client requires you to bring your own [global `fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalFetch/fetch) function. [isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) is a great polyfill.\n\nThen, use as you would anything else:\n\n```js\n// using ES6 modules\nimport { cookieJar } from 'http-client-cookie-jar'\n\n// using CommonJS modules\nvar cookieJar = require('http-client-cookie-jar').cookieJar\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nhttp-client-cookie-jar is mostly useful when building web scrapers. To use it, you'll need to first instantiate a [`CookieJar`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie#cookiejar) and pass it to the middleware. The middleware uses this cookie jar to store all cookies it receives and automatically append them to outgoing requests.\n\n```js\nimport { createFetch } from 'http-client'\nimport { cookieJar } from 'http-client-cookie-jar'\nimport { CookieJar } from 'tough-cookie'\n\nconst jar = new CookieJar\n\nconst fetch = createFetch(\n  cookieJar(jar)\n)\n\nfetch('http://example.com').then(response => {\n  // The cookie jar automatically tracks cookie values that\n  // are returned in the Set-Cookie HTTP header.\n  response.headers.get('Set-Cookie')\n\n  // A Cookie header will automatically be appended to\n  // requests to the same origin.\n  fetch('http://example.com')\n})\n```\n","created":"2016-04-29T04:17:32.535Z","modified":"2016-04-29T04:17:32.535Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mjackson","email":"mjijackson@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mjackson","email":"mjijackson@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-client-cookie-jar","_nodeVersion":"5.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http-client-cookie-jar-0.1.0.tgz_1461903451719_0.9231706764549017"},"_npmUser":{"name":"mjackson","email":"mjijackson@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.7.3","_rev":"1-4e4c9898912eafef12b5a703b4af2d4d","_shasum":"ba5f85eb6b377f76345f794de986b33e7123001e","author":{"name":"Michael Jackson"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mjackson/http-client-cookie-jar/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"ba5f85eb6b377f76345f794de986b33e7123001e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-client-cookie-jar/-/http-client-cookie-jar-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mjackson","email":"mjijackson@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-04-29T04:17:32.535Z","created":"2016-04-29T04:17:32.535Z","0.1.0":"2016-04-29T04:17:32.535Z"}}}
