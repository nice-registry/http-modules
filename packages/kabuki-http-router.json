It has basic session\nsupport and works with any framework supported by\n[promise-route](http://npm.im/promise-route).\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install kabuki-http-router\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport routeBuilder from 'kabuki-http-router'\nimport router from 'koa-router'\nimport koa from 'koa'\n\n// Define a kabuki service\nlet api = (session) => {\n  return session.register('hello', (name) => {\n    return `Hello, ${name}`\n  })\n}\n\n// Build router to map request handlers to service calls\nlet build = routeBuilder(api, {\n  framework: 'koa'\n})\n\n// Create koa app\nlet app = koa()\napp.use(router(app))\n\n// Translate GET /hello/:name requests to service.hello(name) calls\napp.get('/hello/:name', build('hello', [\n  { get: 'params.name' }\n]))\n\napp.listen(3000)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Copyright (c) 2015 Stephen Belanger\n#### Licensed under MIT License\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
