You can create one fairly simply, but there are alot of other factors to take into accont.\n\n* What happens if a user is on a slow connection? Memory usage will shoot up as the socket is buffered\n* Different authentication methods\n* Making it stable. You don't want to kick off happy customers, just because one customer has an error/exception\n* Support different transports, user storage, authentication, routes and sources\n\nThese services, by their very nature, are long lived processes. Any errors will affect all customers connected. I ([OllieParsley](http://ollieparsley.com/)) have experience handling the Twitter firehose and also developing the [DataSift](http://datasift.com/) HTTP Streaming API, which behaves in a similar way to the Twitter Streaming API\n\n## Installation\n\n### NPM\n\n```bash\nnpm install firehose\n```\n\n### Source\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:ollieparsley/node-firehose.git\n```\n\n## Components\n\nThe firehose server is made up of a few big components. These can mostly be combined in anyway to customise the ways a user connects and authenticates with the server.\n\n### Transport\n\nTransports are the different communication methods you have with the user. In the examples directory you will find a ready made HTTP Transport component\n\nIncluded in this module are:\n\n * HTTP\n * WebSockets\n\n### Authentication\n\nIt is really easy to customise how users are authenticated. This takes care of extracting credentials from a request. The default authentication doesn't check any credentials. In the examples directory you will find a Basic Authentication component.\n\n#### Included transports\n\n * No authentication\n * Basic Authentication\n\n### Store\n\nOnce the firehose server has grabbed credentials (if any) they are passed along to a store and expects a User object in response. The default Store returns a randomly generated user. In the examples directory you can find a JSON Store which has all users stored in a JSON file.\n\n#### Included stores\n\n * JSON file storage\n\n### Router\n\nRouters are used to make sure the path specified in a request is correct. The default router allows all requests through.\n\n#### Included routers\n\n * Allow all paths\n * There is an example custom router (in the style of Twitter Streaming API) in the examples\n\n### Source\n\nArguably the most important component. This is the element that receives your own data and passes it to users. The fake source sends a bit of JSON every 2 seconds.\n\n#### Included sources:\n\n * Fake (outputs fake JSON date every 2 seconds)\n * MQTT (listen to topics on an MQTT broker)\n * ZeroMQ (SUB or PULL data from ZMQ sockets)\n * File (tail any file)\n\n## Creating your own components\n\nYou can create your components by extending our base classes. Check out the examples directory for how to do this. Essentially you include our base class for a component and extend any of the methods using prototype inheritance.\n","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2013-07-18T11:20:20.811Z"}],"created":"2013-07-18T11:20:19.677Z","modified":"2013-07-18T11:20:20.811Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ollieparsley","email":"ollie@ollieparsley.com"},"owners":[{"name":"ollieparsley","email":"ollie@ollieparsley.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"firehose","_npmUser":{"name":"ollieparsley","email":"ollie@ollieparsley.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.2.32","_rev":"1-32727a542a39c70815a788d1b9447f99","author":{"name":"Ollie Parsley","email":"ollie@ollieparsley.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ollieparsley/node-firehose/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Ollie Parsley","email":"ollie@ollieparsley.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"a8f14056a8f45d5690290e3a34577e6f8c4a1f8e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/firehose/-/firehose-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ollieparsley","email":"ollie@ollieparsley.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-07-18T11:20:20.811Z","created":"2013-07-18T11:20:19.677Z","0.0.1":"2013-07-18T11:20:20.811Z"}}}
