The path to the endpoint to serve. ('/hello' in the example below)\n       * 2. A function that takes in a request, response and uri as input and performs an\n       *    output on the response object.\n       */\n     \n      endpoints.getEndpoints = [\n        new common.ep('/hello', function(request, response, uri) {\n                response.writeHead(200, {\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"});\n                response.write(JSON.stringify({\"messages\":\"Hello!\"}));\n                response.end();\n        }),\n      ];\n\n\nRunning\n-------\n\nFrom the directory that you want to serve, run:\n\n    node PATH_TO_NIMBL PORT\n\nEg.\n\n    node $NODE_PATH/nimbl/nimbl 9999\n\n\nIf all goes well, when you hit [http://localhost:9999/](http://localhost:9999/) you should see the Nimbl welcome page.\n\n![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssanj/Nimbl/master/nimbl_index.png)\n\nCustomisation\n-------------\n\nIf you want to change the default index page served through nimbl simply create an index.html page of your choosing and drop it in the directory being served. In general, if you request a directory and that directory has a index.html page, it will be shown instead of a 404.\n","created":"2014-04-29T00:47:20.023Z","modified":"2014-05-02T09:06:32.259Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"sanjivsahayam","email":"sanjsmailbox@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"sanjivsahayam","email":"sanjsmailbox@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"nimbl","_npmUser":{"name":"sanjivsahayam","email":"sanjsmailbox@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.14","_rev":"1-4509db6ab32d71756af4c748ea170970","author":{"name":"sanjiv sahayam","email":"sanjsmailbox@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ssanj/Nimbl/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"0e3658cedafa5b779c21cd0a5cea41d0fb94ca04","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/nimbl/-/nimbl-0.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"sanjivsahayam","email":"sanjsmailbox@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-05-02T09:06:32.259Z","created":"2014-04-29T00:47:20.023Z","0.0.1":"2014-04-29T00:47:22.817Z","0.0.3":"2014-05-02T09:06:32.259Z"}}}
