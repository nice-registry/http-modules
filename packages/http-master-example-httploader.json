Http is used in here but obviously any other asynchronous config fetching method can be used, for example fetching from Redit, MySQL etc.\n\n## About config loaders\n\nConfig loader can be any Node.JS module (along with its `node_modules`) which may reside anywhere on the filesystem.\n\nThis module should export a function which accepts 3 arguments:\n`argv` - object representing http-master arguments, may be used for convenience\n`data` - utf8 content of file read by `--config`\n`finish` - function with parameters `(err, config)` which the module should call after receiving a request. It may also be called when after initial request the config has changed.\n\nNote: if --watchConfig was passed, this function may be called multiple times due to file passed as `--config` changing\n```\nmodule.exports = function(argv, data, finish) {\n // module logic here\n}\n```\n\n## Using example loader\n\n* Clone into `/path/to/http-master-example-httploader` and install dependencies with `npm install`\n\n* Create `config.json` with contents (or use example one from this repo for demo)\n```\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://raw2.github.com/CodeCharmLtd/http-master-example-httploader/master/sample.json\"\n}\n```\n\n`http-master --config config.json --configloader /path/to/http-master-example-httploader --show-rules`\n\n## Making a general use loader\n\nOne could publish a loader to NPM and allow global install. You could then use it as.\n`npm install -g http-master-example-httploader`\n\n`http-master --config config.json --configloader http-master-example-httploader --show-rules`\n","created":"2014-01-27T00:35:56.385Z","modified":"2016-04-04T16:50:25.627Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"RushPL","email":"rush@rushbase.net"},"owners":[{"name":"rush","email":"rush@rushbase.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-master-example-httploader","_npmUser":{"name":"RushPL","email":"rush@rushbase.net"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.25","_rev":"1-317ce52332f2c0a194035bb0cb6bca60","author":{"name":"Damian Kaczmarek","email":"damian@codecharm.co.uk"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"5438ba3b0b2bd38e2bc49027610562974fafcf0e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-master-example-httploader/-/http-master-example-httploader-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"rush","email":"rush@rushbase.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-04-04T16:50:25.627Z","created":"2014-01-27T00:35:56.385Z","0.0.1":"2014-01-27T00:35:56.386Z"}}}
