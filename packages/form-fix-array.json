Especially PHP is notorious for refusing to recognize a field as an array unless it specifically has array brackets in the field name. This means that `field=val1&field=val2` will simply be interpreted as `val2`, whereas `field[]=val1&field[]=val2` will be interpreted as an array containing `val1` and `val2`.\n\nThis module ensures that all fields containing an array of values have a `[]` suffix, adding it where necessary (and doing nothing where it is already there). That way, every receiving server should be able to handle the request.\n\nIt does not currently support objects ('associative arrays'), only plain arrays.\n\n## License\n\n[WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/) or [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), whichever you prefer.
