Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-node-server --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-node-server');\n```\n\n## The \"node_server\" task\n\n### Overview\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `node_server` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  node_server: {\n    options: {\n      // Task-specific options go here.\n    },\n    your_target: {\n      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### options.separator\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `',  '`\n\nA string value that is used to do something with whatever.\n\n#### options.punctuation\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `'.'`\n\nA string value that is used to do something else with whatever else.\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n#### Default Options\nIn this example, the default options are used to do something with whatever. So if the `testing` file has the content `Testing` and the `123` file had the content `1 2 3`, the generated result would be `Testing, 1 2 3.`\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  node_server: {\n    options: {},\n    files: {\n      'dest/default_options': ['src/testing', 'src/123'],\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### Custom Options\nIn this example, custom options are used to do something else with whatever else. So if the `testing` file has the content `Testing` and the `123` file had the content `1 2 3`, the generated result in this case would be `Testing: 1 2 3 !!!`\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  node_server: {\n    options: {\n      separator: ': ',\n      punctuation: ' !!!',\n    },\n    files: {\n      'dest/default_options': ['src/testing', 'src/123'],\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n## Release History\n_(Nothing yet)_\n","created":"2015-06-15T14:40:36.843Z","modified":"2016-03-03T14:08:37.885Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ggddll123","email":"ggddll123@qq.com"},"owners":[{"name":"ggddll123","email":"ggddll123@qq.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"grunt-node-server","_nodeVersion":"0.12.4","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/grunt-node-server-0.2.27.tgz_1457014116960_0.14590733940713108"},"_npmUser":{"name":"ggddll123","email":"ggddll123@qq.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.10.1","_rev":"1-a715510ae07e281bc0c453d146315bec","_shasum":"0101fb7741ff77440469e680af3ca3babcb5064a","author":{"name":"alan","email":"ggddll123@qq.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Alan/grunt-node-server/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.27"},"dist":{"shasum":"0101fb7741ff77440469e680af3ca3babcb5064a","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-node-server/-/grunt-node-server-0.2.27.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ggddll123","email":"ggddll123@qq.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-03-03T14:08:37.885Z","created":"2015-06-15T14:40:36.843Z","0.1.0":"2015-06-15T14:40:36.843Z","0.2.0":"2015-06-16T01:21:17.076Z","0.2.1":"2015-06-16T13:49:17.202Z","0.2.2":"2015-06-16T13:53:32.054Z","0.2.3":"2015-06-16T14:02:40.990Z","0.2.4":"2015-06-16T14:06:24.393Z","0.2.5":"2015-06-16T15:45:00.058Z","0.2.6":"2015-06-17T00:58:00.568Z","0.2.7":"2015-06-17T08:47:27.880Z","0.2.8":"2015-06-18T23:52:07.208Z","0.2.9":"2015-06-25T11:53:19.977Z","0.2.10":"2015-06-25T11:57:35.788Z","0.2.11":"2015-06-26T09:14:50.404Z","0.2.12":"2015-07-12T03:55:21.663Z","0.2.13":"2015-08-25T05:57:03.477Z","0.2.14":"2015-08-25T06:05:17.343Z","0.2.15":"2015-12-01T11:23:05.873Z","0.2.16":"2015-12-07T15:58:30.942Z","0.2.17":"2015-12-07T16:07:01.955Z","0.2.18":"2015-12-07T17:10:43.633Z","0.2.20":"2015-12-09T10:52:51.575Z","0.2.21":"2015-12-10T11:45:23.803Z","0.2.22":"2015-12-10T12:02:08.643Z","0.2.23":"2015-12-10T13:55:31.340Z","0.2.24":"2015-12-10T14:04:53.027Z","0.2.25":"2016-02-24T11:43:16.084Z","0.2.26":"2016-02-24T11:44:30.782Z","0.2.27":"2016-03-03T14:08:37.885Z"}}}
