It is based on HTTP.SYS. \nCompared to the built in HTTP stack in node.js it offers kernel mode output caching, port sharing, and kernel mode SSL configuration. Once WebSocket support is added, it will only work starting from Windows 8. Cluster is supported. The module aspires to provide high level of API and behavior compatibility with the built in HTTP stack in node.js. \n\nThis is a very early version of the module. Not much testing or performance optimization had been done. The module had been developed against node.js 0.8.7 (but should work against 0.8.x). Any and all feedback is welcome [here](https://github.com/tjanczuk/httpsys/issues/new).\n\nMore documentation will come; here is how to get started:\n\n```\nnpm install httpsys\n```\n\nThen in your code:\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('httpsys').http();\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, res) {\n  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });\n  res.end('Hello, world!');\n}).listen(8080);\n```\n\nTo use port sharing, provide a full [URL prefix string](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364698(v=vs.85\\).aspx) in the call to `Server.listen`, e.g.:\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('httpsys').http();\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, res) {\n  // ...\n}).listen('http://*:8080/foo/');\n```\n\nAt the same time, you can start another process that listens on a different URL prefix on the same port, e.g. `http://*:8080/bar/`. Each of the processes will only receive requests matching the URL prefix they registered for. \n\nTo inspect or modify HTTP.SYS configuration underlying your server use the `netsh http` command in Windows. This allows you to set various timeout values as well as configure SSL certificates. \n\nAny and all feedback is welcome [here](https://github.com/tjanczuk/httpsys/issues/new).\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2012-08-24T21:00:10.569Z"},{"number":"0.2.0","date":"2012-08-30T20:21:56.008Z"},{"number":"0.3.0","date":"2013-08-14T16:39:50.663Z"},{"number":"0.3.1","date":"2013-08-29T00:06:47.969Z"},{"number":"0.3.2","date":"2013-09-13T17:07:58.098Z"}],"starsCount":1,"created":"2012-08-24T21:00:10.014Z","modified":"2013-09-13T17:07:58.098Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tjanczuk","email":"tomasz@janczuk.org"},"owners":[{"name":"tjanczuk","email":"tomasz@janczuk.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"httpsys","_npmUser":{"name":"tjanczuk","email":"tomasz@janczuk.org"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.8","_rev":"1-d267b9c446aec73e3abbf1c820caf5aa","author":{"name":"Tomasz Janczuk","email":"tomasz@janczuk.org","url":"http://tomasz.janczuk.org"},"bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/tjanczuk/httpsys/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"3553a44ea7f5d12c670541ca6c0f7817a8666fb8","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/httpsys/-/httpsys-0.3.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tjanczuk","email":"tomasz@janczuk.org"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-09-13T17:07:58.098Z","created":"2012-08-24T21:00:10.014Z","0.1.0":"2012-08-24T21:00:10.569Z","0.2.0":"2012-08-30T20:21:56.008Z","0.3.0":"2013-08-14T16:39:50.663Z","0.3.1":"2013-08-29T00:06:47.969Z","0.3.2":"2013-09-13T17:07:58.098Z"},"users":{"digitalextremist":true}}}
