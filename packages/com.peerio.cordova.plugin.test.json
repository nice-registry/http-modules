Check which Xcode command-line tools is in use by running:\n\n    xcode-select --print-path\n\n\nNotes\n------\n\nOn an iOS 8 system, Apache Cordova during runtime will switch to using the UIWebView engine instead of using this plugin. If you want to use WKWebView on both iOS 8 and iOS 9 platforms, you will have to resort to using a local webserver.\n\nWe have an [experimental plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugins/tree/master/wkwebview-engine-localhost) that does this. You would use that plugin instead of this one.\n\nApplication Transport Security (ATS) in iOS 9\n-----------\n\nThe next released version of the [cordova-cli 5.4.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova) will support automatic conversion of the [&lt;access&gt;](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide/appdev/whitelist/index.html) tags in config.xml to Application Transport Security [ATS](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW33) directives. Upgrade to the version 5.4.0 to use this new functionality.\n\nLimitations\n--------\n\nIf you are upgrading from UIWebView, please note the limitations of using WKWebView as outlined in our [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CB%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20wkwebview-known-issues).\n\nApple Issues\n-------\n\nThe `AllowInlineMediaPlayback` preference will not work because of this [Apple bug](http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6673091526656000). \n\nPermissions\n-----------\n\n#### config.xml\n\n        <feature name=\"CDVWKWebViewEngine\">\n            <param name=\"ios-package\" value=\"CDVWKWebViewEngine\" />\n        </feature>\n\n        <preference name=\"CordovaWebViewEngine\" value=\"CDVWKWebViewEngine\" />\n\nSupported Platforms\n-------------------\n\n- iOS\n","created":"2016-04-18T12:41:52.287Z","modified":"2016-04-18T12:41:52.287Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"seavan","email":"seavan@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"seavan","email":"seavan@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"com.peerio.cordova.plugin.test","_nodeVersion":"4.2.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/com.peerio.cordova.plugin.test-1.0.6.tgz_1460983310796_0.5952895442023873"},"_npmUser":{"name":"seavan","email":"seavan@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"1-521021b811cbf197dad3dbbc645436b1","_shasum":"5f5979cc56915dc9e8d9ecc1e06414a85c0eeace","author":{"name":"Apache Cordova"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/PeerioTechnologies/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"5f5979cc56915dc9e8d9ecc1e06414a85c0eeace","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/com.peerio.cordova.plugin.test/-/com.peerio.cordova.plugin.test-1.0.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"seavan","email":"seavan@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-04-18T12:41:52.287Z","created":"2016-04-18T12:41:52.287Z","1.0.6":"2016-04-18T12:41:52.287Z"}}}
