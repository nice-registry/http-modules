Otherwise, `request` will mix multiple services together.\n\n### Options\n\n * `service`: Service designator to look for, prepended to the hostname. Defaults to `_http._tcp.`.\n\n### Limitations\n\n * Services are not checked for connectivity. Currently, it will only select a weighted random service at the highest priority.\n * SSL is not supported.\n\nPull request to fix these issues are welcome.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n$ npm install service-agent\n```\n\n# License\n\n(BSD 2-Clause License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2016, Gil Pedersen &lt;gpdev@gpost.dk&gt;\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
