It's a _slightly_\nopinionated implementation of [express](http://expressjs.com) that enforces\ngood practices and simplifies development.\n\nThe following features are built in:\n\n1. Simple Routing\n1. Automatic Refresh\n1. CORS support\n1. TLS/SSL support\n1. Autostart\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nrequire('ngn')\nrequire('ngnx-http')\n\nlet server = new NGNX.http.Server({\n  poweredby: 'Acme Corp.'\n})\n\nserver.createRoutes('./path/to/routes')\n```\n\nThe code above will automatically start a web server on port 80 using the\nroutes defined in `/path/to/routes.js`. That file may look like:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (app) {\n  app.get('/echo', function (req, res) {\n    res.status(200).send(req.body)\n  })\n\n  app.get('/ping', function (req, res) {\n    res.sendStatus(200)\n  })\n}\n```\n\nWe like to use a variation of this that relies on separating functionality into\nmodules:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function (app) {\n  let auth = require('./tokenauth.js')\n  let users = require('./my/users')\n\n  app.post('/user', auth.required, users.create)\n  app.get('/user/:id', auth.required, users.read)\n  app.put('/user/:id', auth.required, users.update)\n  app.delete('/user/:id', auth.required, users.delete)\n  app.get('/users', users.list)\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Refresh\n\nBy default, automatic refresh is enabled. It's better to turn this off in\nproduction (which can be done through an environment variable), but it can\nreally speed up development.\n\nThe `server.createRoutes()` method is unique. It identifies files like the\nexample above and adds the routes. It also monitors these files for changes\nand updates the server without restarting it (hot-route-loading).\nWhen a file is removed, it's routes are removed. When a file is modified, the\nroutes are synchronized.\n\nIt's unlikely that a file will be deleted and recreated, but if it is, the\nroutes will automatically be added when the file is re-added.\n","created":"2016-04-14T01:23:34.714Z","modified":"2016-11-23T20:54:06.078Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"cbutler","email":"corey@coreybutler.com"},"owners":[{"name":"cbutler","email":"corey@coreybutler.com"},{"name":"nodengn","email":"sysadmin@coreybutler.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ngnx-http","_nodeVersion":"6.2.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/ngnx-http-0.0.18.tgz_1479934445552_0.07647192873992026"},"_npmUser":{"name":"cbutler","email":"corey@coreybutler.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.9.5","_rev":"6-bc4f5372c25ee67a34f0e9d35c63a5da","_shasum":"58d591e78510deec2f9f904c53e8285b1d562909","author":{"name":"Corey Butler"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.18"},"dist":{"shasum":"58d591e78510deec2f9f904c53e8285b1d562909","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ngnx-http/-/ngnx-http-0.0.18.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cbutler","email":"corey@coreybutler.com"},{"name":"nodengn","email":"sysadmin@coreybutler.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-11-23T20:54:06.078Z","created":"2016-04-14T01:23:34.714Z","0.0.1":"2016-04-14T01:23:34.714Z","0.0.2":"2016-04-14T01:56:16.619Z","0.0.3":"2016-04-14T02:11:25.382Z","0.0.4":"2016-04-20T19:16:58.538Z","0.0.5":"2016-04-21T19:09:46.836Z","0.0.6":"2016-04-21T21:01:31.797Z","0.0.7":"2016-04-22T20:54:46.141Z","0.0.8":"2016-08-12T23:15:08.799Z","0.0.9":"2016-08-13T19:37:35.053Z","0.0.10":"2016-08-13T19:47:59.089Z","0.0.11":"2016-08-28T00:50:38.564Z","0.0.12":"2016-08-28T15:26:13.505Z","0.0.13":"2016-10-10T23:23:26.004Z","0.0.14":"2016-10-27T20:12:54.870Z","0.0.15":"2016-10-27T20:19:03.401Z","0.0.16":"2016-11-21T04:41:01.182Z","0.0.17":"2016-11-23T16:22:53.678Z","0.0.18":"2016-11-23T20:54:06.078Z"}}}
