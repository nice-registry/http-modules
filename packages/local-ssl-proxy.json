Intended for local development only.\n\nInstall\n-------\n```sh\nnpm install -g local-ssl-proxy\n```\n\nRun\n---\nTo start a proxy from port `9001` to `9000` run:\n```sh\nlocal-ssl-proxy --source 9001 --target 9000\n```\n\nStart your web server on the target port (`9000` in the example) and navigate to `https://localhost:<target-port>` ([https://localhost:9001](https://localhost:9001) in the example). You'll get a warning because the certificate is self-signed, this is safe to ignore during development.\n\nUsing a dynamic DNS provider such as [noip](http://www.noip.com/personal/) or [DynDNS](http://dyn.com/dns/) or a static IP (if you have one) you can open a port in your firewall to allow external sites to call into your web server. This is great for developing applications using [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) without having to deploy externally.\n\nAdvanced\n--------\nYou can also pass a configuration file, this helps sharing setups with team members. These can contain multiple proxies which `local-ssl-proxy` will open concurrently.\n\nExample config:\n```json\n{\n  \"My proxy\": {\n    \"source\": 3001,\n    \"target\": 3000\n  },\n  \"Another proxy\": {\n    \"source\": 9999,\n    \"target\": 9000\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the proxy with the configuration file:\n```sh\nlocal-ssl-proxy --config config.json\n```\n","created":"2015-03-01T08:26:54.509Z","modified":"2016-02-03T08:06:13.150Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"cameronhunter","email":"hello@cameronhunter.co.uk"},"owners":[{"name":"cameronhunter","email":"hello@cameronhunter.co.uk"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"local-ssl-proxy","_nodeVersion":"4.2.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-6-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/local-ssl-proxy-1.3.0.tgz_1454486772397_0.5143348113633692"},"_npmUser":{"name":"cameronhunter","email":"hello@cameronhunter.co.uk"},"_npmVersion":"3.5.2","_rev":"1-876cca0d98fb582c84392157efcae24d","_shasum":"f9bcd5d3039a27a775ffc81585294259e9d340a8","author":{"name":"Cameron Hunter","email":"hello@cameronhunter.co.uk"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/cameronhunter/local-ssl-proxy/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.3.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"f9bcd5d3039a27a775ffc81585294259e9d340a8","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/local-ssl-proxy/-/local-ssl-proxy-1.3.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cameronhunter","email":"hello@cameronhunter.co.uk"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-02-03T08:06:13.150Z","created":"2015-03-01T08:26:54.509Z","1.0.0":"2015-03-01T08:26:54.509Z","1.1.0":"2015-07-02T21:29:26.935Z","1.1.1":"2015-11-12T22:13:32.117Z","1.1.2":"2015-11-12T22:21:59.749Z","1.1.3":"2015-11-12T22:29:33.469Z","1.2.0":"2015-11-12T23:48:03.713Z","1.2.1":"2015-11-12T23:50:18.657Z","1.2.2":"2015-11-12T23:53:04.661Z","1.2.3":"2016-02-01T22:04:00.774Z","1.3.0":"2016-02-03T08:06:13.150Z"}}}
