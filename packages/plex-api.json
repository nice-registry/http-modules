Default is a `generated uuid v4`. *Note: you should really provide this rather than let it get generated. Every time your app runs, a new \"device\" will get registered on your Plex account, which can lead to poor performance once hundreds or thousands of them get created. Trust me!*\n\t- **product**: The name of your application. Official Plex examples: `Plex Web`, `Plex Home Theater`, `Plex for Xbox One`. Default `Node.js App`\n\t- **version**: The version of your app. Default `1.0`\n\t- **deviceName**: The \"name\" of the device your app is running on. For apps like Plex Home Theater and mobile apps, it's the computer or phone's name chosen by the user. Default `Node.js App`\n\t- **platform**: The platform your app is running on. The use of this is inconsistent in the official Plex apps. It is not displayed on the web interface. Official Plex examples: `Chrome`, `Plex Home Theater`, `Windows`. Default is `Node.js`.\n\t- **platformVersion**: The platform version. Default is the version of Node running.\n\t- **device**: The name of the type of computer your app is running on, usually the OS name. Official Plex examples: `Windows`, `iPhone`, `Xbox One`. Default is whatever `os.platform()` returns.\n\nHere's an example of what an app shows up as on the Plex web interface\n\n![Plex Device Example](docs/plex-device-example.png?raw)\n\nThe rows in that example from top to bottom are `deviceName`, `version`, `product`, and `device`.\n\n### .query(options)\n\n**Retrieve content from URI**\n\nThe parameter can be a string representing the URI, or an object with the following properties:\n- **uri**: the URI to query\n- (optional) **extraHeaders**: an object with extra headers to send in the HTTP request. Useful for things like X-Plex-Target-Client-Identifier\n\nAside from requesting the API and returning its response, an `.uri` property are created to easier follow the URIs available in the HTTP API. At the moment URIs are attached for Directory and Server items.\n\n```js\nvar PlexAPI = require(\"plex-api\");\nvar client = new PlexAPI(\"192.168.0.1\");\n\nclient.query(\"/\").then(function (result) {\n\tconsole.log(\"%s running Plex Media Server v%s\",\n\t\tresult.friendlyName,\n\t\tresult.version);\n\n\t// array of children, such as Directory or Server items\n\t// will have the .uri-property attached\n\tconsole.log(result._children);\n}, function (err) {\n\tconsole.error(\"Could not connect to server\", err);\n});\n```\n\n### .postQuery(options)\n\n**Send a POST request and retrieve the response**\n\nThis is identical to `query()`, except that the request will be a POST rather than a GET. It has the same required and optional parameters as `query()`.\n\nNote that the parameters can only be passed as a query string as part of the uri, which is all Plex requires. (`Content-Length` will always be zero)\n\n```js\nvar PlexAPI = require(\"plex-api\");\nvar client = new PlexAPI(\"192.168.0.1\");\n\nclient.postQuery(\"/playQueue?type=video&uri=someuri&shuffle=0\").then(function (result) {\n\tconsole.log(\"Added video to playQueue %s\",\n\t\tresult.playQueueID);\n\n\t// array of children, such as Directory or Server items\n\t// will have the .uri-property attached\n\tconsole.log(result._children);\n}, function (err) {\n\tconsole.error(\"Could not connect to server\", err);\n});\n```\n\n### .putQuery(options)\n\n**Send a PUT request and retrieve the response**\n\nThis is identical to `query()`, except that the request will be a PUT rather than a GET. It has the same required and optional parameters as `query()`. It's is used to update parts of your Plex library.\n\nNote that the parameters can only be passed as a query string as part of the uri, which is all Plex requires. (`Content-Length` will always be zero)\n\n```js\nvar PlexAPI = require(\"plex-api\");\nvar client = new PlexAPI(\"192.168.0.1\");\n\nclient.putQuery(\"/library/sections/3/all?type=1&id=123&summary.value=updatedSummaryText\")\n\t.then(function (result) {\n\t\tconsole.log(\"Description of video by id 123 has been set to 'updatedSummaryText'\");\n\t}, function (err) {\n\t\tconsole.error(\"Could not connect to server\", err);\n\t});\n```\n\n### .perform(options)\n\n**Perform an API action**\n\nWhen performing an \"action\" on the HTTP API, the response body will be empty.\nAs the response content itself is worthless, `perform()` acts on the HTTP status codes the server responds with.\nIt has the same required and optional parameters as `query()`.\n\n```js\nvar PlexAPI = require(\"plex-api\");\nvar client = new PlexAPI(\"192.168.0.1\");\n\n// update library section of key \"1\"\nclient.perform(\"/library/sections/1/refresh\").then(function () {\n\t// successfully started to refresh library section #1\n}, function (err) {\n\tconsole.error(\"Could not connect to server\", err);\n});\n```\n\n### .find(options, [{criterias}])\n\n**Find matching child items on URI**\n\nUses `query()` behind the scenes, giving all directories and servers the beloved `.uri` property. It has the same required and optional parameters as `query`, in addition to a second optional `criterias` parameter.\n\n```js\nvar PlexAPI = require(\"plex-api\");\nvar client = new PlexAPI(\"192.168.0.1\");\n\n// filter directories on Directory attributes\nclient.find(\"/library/sections\", {type: \"movie\"}).then(function (directories) {\n\t// directories would be an array of sections whose type are \"movie\"\n}, function (err) {\n\tconsole.error(\"Could not connect to server\", err);\n});\n\n// criterias are interpreted as regular expressions\nclient.find(\"/library/sections\", {type: \"movie|shows\"}).then(function (directories) {\n\t// directories type would be \"movie\" OR \"shows\"\n}, function (err) {\n\tconsole.error(\"Could not connect to server\", err);\n});\n\n// shorthand to retrieve all Directories\nclient.find(\"/\").then(function (directories) {\n\t// directories would be an array of Directory items\n}, function (err) {\n\tthrow new Error(\"Could not connect to server\");\n});\n```\n\n## Authenticators\n\nAn authenticator is used by plex-api to authenticate its request against Plex Servers with a PlexHome setup. The most common authentication mechanism is by username and password.\n\nYou can provide your own custom authentication mechanism, read more about custom authenticators below.\n\n### Credentials: username and password\n\nComes bundled with plex-api. Just provide `options.username` and `options.password` when creating a PlexAPI instance and you are good to go.\n\nSee the [plex-api-credentials](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plex-api-credentials) module for more information about its inner workings.\n\n### PIN: authenticate by PIN code\n\nAn authentication module that provides an interface for authenticating with Plex using a PIN, like the official clients do.\n\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/plex-api-pinauth\n\n### Custom authenticator\n\nIn its simplest form an `authenticator` is an object with **one required** function `authenticate()` which should return the autentication token needed by plex-api to satisfy Plex Server.\n\nAn optional method `initialize()` could be implemented if you need reference to the created PlexAPI instance when it's created.\n\n```js\n{\n  // OPTIONAL\n  initialize: function(plexApi) {\n    // plexApi === the PlexAPI instance just created\n  },\n  // REQUIRED\n  authenticate: function(plexApi, callback) {\n    // plexApi === the PlexAPI instance requesting the authentication token\n\n    // invoke callback if something fails\n    if (somethingFailed) {\n      return callback(new Error('I haz no cluez about token!'));\n    }\n\n    // or when you have a token\n    callback(null, 'I-found-this-token');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Response parsing\n\nYou can provide a custom function responsible for parsing all Plex Server responses if you need to, by providing it in the `responseParser` when instantiating a Plex API client.\n\nThe default implementation either parses the JSON in the response from the Plex Server, converts XML to a JavaScript object or returns the response as is, depending on the response Content-Type header.\n\nA response parsing function gets two arguments provided: `response`, `body` and is expected to return a `Promise`.\n\n```js\nfunction myCustomJsonResponseParser(response, body) {\n\tconst bodyAsString = body.toString('ut8');\n\n\treturn Promise.resolve(bodyAsString).then(JSON.parse);\n}\n```\n\n## HTTP API Documentation\nFor more information about the API capabilities, see the [unofficial Plex API documentation](https://github.com/Arcanemagus/plex-api/wiki). The [PlexInc's desktop client wiki](https://github.com/plexinc/plex-media-player/wiki/Remote-control-API) might also be valueable.\n\n## Running tests\n\n```shell\n$ npm install\n$ npm test\n```\n\nAutomatically run all tests whenever files has been changed:\n```shell\n$ npm run test:watch\n```\n\n**NB!** This project runs [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for code formatting.\nThe test script will fail if prettier rules are not followed. Scripts can be formatted by running:\n\n```bash\n$ npm run format\n```\n\nor by adding an editor plugin/extension as described in the [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) project.\n\n## Usage in the wild\n\nplex-api has proven to be useful in more than one project over the years.\n\nDo you have project which uses plex-api? Please tell us about it and we'll list it here :)\n\n### alexa-plex\n\nAlexa (Amazon Echo) app for interacting with a Plex Server and controlling client playback.\n\nhttps://github.com/OverloadUT/alexa-plex by [@OverloadUT](https://github.com/OverloadUT).\n\n### nl.kikkert.plex\n\nThe Plex Remote control app for the Homey device.\n\nhttps://github.com/MikeOne/nl.kikkert.plex by [@MikeOne](https://github.com/MikeOne).\n\n### plex2netflix\n\nSee how much of your media from Plex is available on Netflix with a CLI command.\n\nhttps://github.com/SpaceK33z/plex2netflix by [@SpaceK33z](https://github.com/SpaceK33z).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are more than welcome!
