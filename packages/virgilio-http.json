The response of the action will be returned with a\n200 status code. If you want different behaviour, you can define your own\ntransform:\n\n```javascript\n//This example requires the `bodyParser` middleware.\nvirgilio.add.post('/allcaps')\n    .transform(function(req, res) {\n        var words = req.body;\n        return this.execute$(words.join(' '))\n            .then(function(result) {\n                res.send(200, { scream: result });\n            });\n    });\n```\n\nIn other words, it's just like an ordinary middleware, with the exception that\nyou can use `this.execute$` to call the underlying action and the absence of a\n`next` callback. Instead, the returned promise, once resolved, triggers the next\nmiddleware.\n\nNow suppose you want to add some validation to this route. Easy:\n\n```javascript\nvirgilio.add.get('/allcaps/:words')\n    .addHandler(myValidationMiddleware(schema))\n    .addHandler(myAuthenticationMiddleware())\n    .transform();\n```\n\nEach function passed to `addHandler` gets called with a `req` and `res` object\nand should return a promise that will trigger the next handler in the stack. A\n`transform` with no arguments will insert the default handler described above at\nthat position.\n\nOf course, it's also possible to add generic middleware to be used with every\nroute:\n\n```javascript\nvirgilio.http.use(virgilio.http.bodyParser());\n```\n\nRestify's bundled middlewares are made available from `virgilio.http`. It is\nadvised extensions that add additional middlewares also store them there.\n\n## More Tags\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/icemobilelab/virgilio-http/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/icemobilelab/virgilio-http)\n[![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/icemobilelab/virgilio-http/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/icemobilelab/virgilio-http)\n[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/icemobilelab/virgilio-http.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/icemobilelab/virgilio-http)\n","created":"2014-05-16T20:51:59.410Z","modified":"2014-11-05T15:36:12.837Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"icemobile","email":"icemobilelab@icemobile.com"},"owners":[{"name":"icemobile","email":"icemobilelab@icemobile.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"virgilio-http","_npmUser":{"name":"icemobile","email":"icemobilelab@icemobile.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_rev":"1-686e44620866b23b5fad4e51f5e3a04b","_shasum":"9bc9af11cdf7719fb96fbcd316af1f16965aa259","author":{"name":"IceMobile"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/icemobilelab/virgilio-http/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.8.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"9bc9af11cdf7719fb96fbcd316af1f16965aa259","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/virgilio-http/-/virgilio-http-0.8.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"icemobile","email":"icemobilelab@icemobile.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-11-05T15:36:12.837Z","created":"2014-05-16T20:51:59.410Z","0.1.0":"2014-05-16T20:51:59.410Z","0.2.0":"2014-05-22T09:21:08.181Z","0.3.0":"2014-06-18T13:17:14.658Z","0.5.0":"2014-07-22T08:59:25.183Z","0.5.1":"2014-07-24T08:13:08.684Z","0.5.2":"2014-07-28T06:56:39.851Z","0.6.2":"2014-07-30T07:14:42.516Z","0.6.3":"2014-07-30T10:43:51.674Z","0.6.4":"2014-07-31T13:40:35.701Z","0.6.5":"2014-08-15T10:54:15.876Z","0.6.6":"2014-08-15T11:50:12.711Z","0.6.7":"2014-08-15T12:29:05.445Z","0.7.0":"2014-10-21T08:55:19.108Z","0.8.0":"2014-10-21T10:22:46.284Z","0.8.1":"2014-11-05T15:36:12.837Z"}}}
