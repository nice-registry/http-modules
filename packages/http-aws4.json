Allowed flags:\n\n| Flag | Meaning          |\n|:----:|------------------|\n| `H`  | Request headers  |\n| `B`  | Request body     |\n| `h`  | Response headers |\n| `b`  | Response body    |\n\nFor example, `-p Hhb` would print the request headers, the response headers, and\nthe response body.\n\nThe default value is `hb` (response headers and response body), except for\nredirected output, where it is `b` (response body).\n\n### --pretty OUTPUT\n\nControls pretty-printing of the response body. Allowed values:\n\n| Value    | Meaning                    |\n|:--------:|----------------------------|\n| `all`    | Both colors and formatting |\n| `colors` | Just colors                |\n| `format` | Just formatting            |\n| `none`   | Raw                        |\n\nThe default value is `all`, except for redirected output, where it is `none`.\n\n### --region REGION, -r REGION\n\nIf the name of the AWS region cannot be detected from the URL, use this option\nto set it manually.\n\n### --service SERVICE, -s SERVICE\n\nIf the name of the AWS service cannot be detected from the URL, use this option\nto set it manually.\n\n### --profile PROFILE\n\nUses the specified profile. Note that setting this option will force reading\ncredentials from the credentials file rather than from the environment.\n\n### --no-color\n\nIf you prefer not to colorize the output at all, pass this option, provided by\n[supports-color](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supports-color).\n\n## Request Headers\n\nRequest headers can be specified after the URL as a space-separated list of\nname-value pairs, separated by a colon character. For example, this command\nwould set the `X-Foo` header to `bar`, and the `X-Baz` header to `quux`:\n\n```bash\nhaws https://... x-foo:bar x-baz:quux\n```\n\n## Request Body\n\nThe process's standard input will be used as the request body. For example, if\nyou have prepared an Elasticsearch bulk API request body in `body.json`, you\ncan post it as follows:\n\n```bash\nhaws post https://search-....us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_bulk <body.json\n```\n\n## Author\n\n[Tim De Pauw](https://github.com/timdp)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","created":"2017-01-15T13:40:27.947Z","modified":"2017-06-18T08:51:55.610Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"timdp","email":"hi@tmdpw.eu"},"owners":[{"name":"timdp","email":"hi@tmdpw.eu"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-aws4","_nodeVersion":"6.11.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/http-aws4-0.10.0.tgz_1497775914685_0.7836445507127792"},"_npmUser":{"name":"timdp","email":"hi@tmdpw.eu"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"14-aa6df2d9ae3c124b966012f592aabf63","_shasum":"0ae56d6c1a595302ec99d6fc8028871b6ac50f0e","author":{"name":"Tim De Pauw","email":"hi@tmdpw.eu","url":"https://tmdpw.eu/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/timdp/http-aws4/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.10.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"0ae56d6c1a595302ec99d6fc8028871b6ac50f0e","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/http-aws4/-/http-aws4-0.10.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"timdp","email":"hi@tmdpw.eu"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-18T08:51:55.610Z","created":"2017-01-15T13:40:27.947Z","0.1.0":"2017-01-15T13:40:27.947Z","0.1.1":"2017-01-18T15:22:32.278Z","0.2.0":"2017-02-03T15:34:04.299Z","0.3.0":"2017-02-03T15:41:50.090Z","0.4.0":"2017-02-17T22:03:33.796Z","0.4.1":"2017-03-26T11:28:09.814Z","0.5.0":"2017-03-27T13:05:22.459Z","0.5.1":"2017-04-09T12:56:08.579Z","0.6.0":"2017-04-10T09:49:14.831Z","0.7.0":"2017-04-12T07:42:32.814Z","0.8.0":"2017-06-07T16:39:07.139Z","0.8.1":"2017-06-07T16:41:55.362Z","0.9.0":"2017-06-18T07:52:23.084Z","0.10.0":"2017-06-18T08:51:55.610Z"}}}
