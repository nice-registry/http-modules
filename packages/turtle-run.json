Example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"target\": \"http://localhost:3003\",\n  \"port\": 8008,\n  \"debug\": true,\n  \"urls\": {\n    \".js$\": 2000,\n    \"app.js\": 2000,\n    \".html$\": 1000,\n    \"foo.js$\": { \"response\": 500 }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nStart *turtle-run* in the folder with *turtle.json*. The proxy watches the file and restarts on any changes.\nIn the above case, the proxy will listen on local port 8008 and forward any requests to `http://localhost:3003`.\nRequests containing `.js` at the end will be delayed by 2 seconds. JavaScript file `app.js` will be delayed by\n4 seconds (2 seconds for every js file and 2 seconds because it matches `app.js`). HTML files will be delayed \nby 1 second. All other requests will not be delayed.\n\nThe proxy will also return code 500 for resource `foo.js`.\n\n`debug` flag tells proxy to output request information to console log.\n\n### Small print\n\nAuthor: Gleb Bahmutov &copy; 2014\n\n* [@bahmutov](https://twitter.com/bahmutov)\n* [glebbahmutov.com](http://glebbahmutov.com)\n* [blog](http://bahmutov.calepin.co/)\n\nLicense: MIT - do anything with the code, but don't blame me if it does not work.\n\nSpread the word: tweet, star on github, etc.\n\nSupport: if you find any problems with this module, email / tweet /\n[open issue](https://github.com/bahmutov/turtle-run/issues) on Github\n\n## MIT License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Gleb Bahmutov\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
