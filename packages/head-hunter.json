Let's you proxy HTTP requests and watch headers for\nrequests matching your description\n\n##Usage\nBasic usage:\n\n    $ head-hunter <url regex>\n    \nTo watch everything:\n\n    $ head-hunter \".*\"\n    \nTo watch all .pdf files on a site:\n\n    $ head-hunter \"^http://www.example.com/.*\\.pdf\"\n\nTo watch all .pdf files on your local development site:\n\n    $ head-hunter \"^http://localhost:8080/.*\\.pdf\"\n\n##Requirements\nYou will need [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/).\nThe package is set for a minimum node requiremnt of 0.6.14 simply because that\nis what is installed on my system when I wrote it. It may work with earlier\nversions but I can't verify it.\n\n##Installation\n\n    $ npm install head-hunter -g\n\n\n##What is it?\nThis node based application acts as a local proxy running on your local system.\nSimply configure it with a `regex` to watch and whenever a request is made to the\nmatching url the request and response headers will be dumped to the console.\n\n##How do I use it?\nJust start running the application with a regex for the requests you are\ninterested in. Be sure to set your system proxy to `localhost` on port `3128`.\nFrom now on all web requests on your system will be pass through head hunter, and\nany requests that match your regex will have both the request and response headers\ndisplayed.\n\n##Why did you make it?\nI recently had a need to monitor the headers of certain web requests. Using the\nstandard browser based development tools to watch the headers wasn't an option\nsince the problem was occuring with the Adobe PDF Plugin and byte range requests.\n\nThere is probably something else out there but I wanted an excuse to write something\nin node - plus by the time I finish researching and installing another solution\nit would be done - damn I love being a web programmer!\n \n##Limitations\nObviously it won't do SSL. The current incarnation has been written quite quickly\nso I can simply get results, but I intend to improve this. Want to help? \n\n##Future ideas\n- Monitored configuration file of interesting regex\n- Storing request/headers to file, db or email\n- Multiple configurations\n- Transparent proxy: that way you could have all your internal users using it and\nif there is one or two people with a problem that can't be replicated just simply\n\"flick a switch\" to start monitoring","created":"2012-04-14T12:19:38.099Z","modified":"2012-04-14T12:19:43.712Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"alchemycs","email":"developer@yrucalling.me"},"owners":[{"name":"alchemycs","email":"developer@yrucalling.me"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"head-hunter","_nodeVersion":"v0.6.14","_npmUser":{"name":"alchemycs","email":"developer@yrucalling.me"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.12","_rev":"1-9d3007a78f11253c90b7fa5ba4613abd","author":{"name":"Michael McHugh","email":"developer@yrucalling.me","url":"http://alchemycs.github.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/alchemycs/head-hunter/issues"},"contributors":[],"directories":{"lib":"./lib"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"c6f795ece2b9f8ff8f77b25520e0518b59f4330e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/head-hunter/-/head-hunter-0.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"alchemycs","email":"developer@yrucalling.me"}],"time":{"modified":"2012-04-14T12:19:43.712Z","created":"2012-04-14T12:19:38.099Z","0.0.2":"2012-04-14T12:19:43.712Z"}}}
