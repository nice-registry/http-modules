Defaults to localhost.\n  - port: port to use. Defaults to 2113\n  - ssl: true to connect over ssl. Defaults to false\n  - rejectUnauthorized: false to disable rejecting unauthorized requests based on the validity of ssl certs. Defaults to true.\n  - timeout: Timeout for calls, Defaults to 5 seconds.\n  - maxDataSize: The maximum data size sent to a stream. Defaults to 1048576 (1mb).\n  - maxCacheSize: The number of objects to cache locally to speed up retrieval. Defaults to 1000.\n\n### `client.write(streamName, data, eventType, callback)`\n\nWrites an item into a stream. A stream will automatically be created if this is the first time an object has been written to it.\n- `streamName` - A string specifying the stream name.\n- `data` - An object to be stored.\n- `eventType` - The event type to record when writing this object to the stream.\n- `callback` - Called when the function completes using the signature `function (err)` where:\n    - `err` - Any error that may have occurred during the handling of the request.\n\n### `client.readFirst(streamName, callback)`\n\nReads the latest item added to the stream.\n- `streamName` - A string specifying the stream name.\n- `callback` - Called when the function completes using the signature `function (err, data)` where:\n    - `err` - Any error that may have occurred during the handling of the request.\n    - `data` - The object that was stored last.\n\n### `client.readLast(streamName, callback)`\n\nReads the first item added to the stream.\n- `streamName` - A string specifying the stream name.\n- `callback` - Called when the function completes using the signature `function (err, data)` where:\n    - `err` - Any error that may have occurred during the handling of the request.\n    - `data` - The original object stored in the stream.\n\n### `client.readPrevious(streamName, callback)`\n\nReads the next newest item from the current position. The starting position can be set by calling readFirst or readLast.\n- `streamName` - A string specifying the stream name.\n- `callback` - Called when the function completes using the signature `function (err, data)` where:\n    - `err` - Any error that may have occurred during the handling of the request.\n    - `data` - The object stored at the the position.\n\n### `client.readNext(streamName, callback)`\n\nReads the previous older item from the current position. The starting position can be set by calling readFirst or readLast.\n- `streamName` - A string specifying the stream name.\n- `callback` - Called when the function completes using the signature `function (err, data)` where:\n    - `err` - Any error that may have occurred during the handling of the request.\n    - `data` - The object stored at the position.\n\n\n### `client.deleteStream(streamName, hardDelete, callback)`\n\nDeletes a stream.\n- `streamName` - A string specifying the stream name.\n- `hardDelete` - Set to true to permanently delete the stream.\n- `callback` - Called when the function completes using the signature `function (err)` where:\n    - `err` - Any error that may have occurred during the handling of the request.\n\n\n## Test\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n","created":"2015-06-11T10:55:52.285Z","modified":"2015-09-23T21:02:40.949Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"colmharte","email":"colm.harte@nearform.com"},"owners":[{"name":"colmharte","email":"colm.harte@nearform.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"geteventstore-client","_npmUser":{"name":"colmharte","email":"colm.harte@nearform.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_rev":"1-1822ec3ef976fe67455a898ecdddd356","_shasum":"dc2b8ae70249b209cdb6e42774177a6f13a61cf6","author":{"name":"Colm Harte","email":"colm.harte@nearform.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/colmharte/geteventstore-client/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"dc2b8ae70249b209cdb6e42774177a6f13a61cf6","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/geteventstore-client/-/geteventstore-client-0.1.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"colmharte","email":"colm.harte@nearform.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-09-23T21:02:40.949Z","created":"2015-06-11T10:55:52.285Z","0.1.0":"2015-06-11T10:55:52.285Z","0.1.1":"2015-06-11T11:28:34.967Z","0.1.2":"2015-06-11T11:34:01.441Z","0.1.3":"2015-06-11T11:37:06.330Z","0.1.4":"2015-06-11T13:19:09.229Z","0.1.5":"2015-06-11T13:51:49.264Z","0.1.6":"2015-09-23T21:02:40.949Z"}}}
