They are located on the bottom-left of the remote motherboard and are (from top to bottom):\n- Down\n- Stop\n- Up\n- Common\n\nRemember to run `npm install` before actually running the server.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo start the server, simply type the following command on your terminal. You'll probably need to be **root** or execute the script as **sudo** for GPIO access.\n\n```bash\n(sudo) node index.js \n```\n\nYou can also display debug logs on your terminal with the following command.\n\n```bash\nDEBUG=Profalux* (sudo -E) node index.js\n```\n\nThe application will initialize the GPIO pins and start the webserver. By default, it will listen globally on port 19240. You can change the port number in the config file.\n\nThen you'll be able to issue commands on your roller shutter with a PUT request on these URLs:\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://raspberrypi:19240/shutter/up\ncurl -X PUT http://raspberrypi:19240/shutter/stop\ncurl -X PUT http://raspberrypi:19240/shutter/down\n```\n\n### Web interface\n\nYou can control your shutter with a virtual remote by going to `http://raspberrypi:19240/`, where:\n- `raspberrypi` is the IP address or the local network name of your Raspberry Pi\n- `19240` is the port specified in the configuration file\n\n## Todo\n- [x] Create a simple web interface\n- [ ] Handle multiple shutters\n- [ ] Compute approximate shutter position\n","created":"2016-10-11T20:06:17.266Z","modified":"2016-10-15T12:00:08.137Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"dhaya","email":"dhaya.benmessaoud@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"dhaya","email":"dhaya.benmessaoud@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"rpi-profalux-shutters","_nodeVersion":"6.5.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/rpi-profalux-shutters-0.1.0.tgz_1476532806304_0.3830447727814317"},"_npmUser":{"name":"dhaya","email":"dhaya.benmessaoud@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.3","_rev":"1-87c7c5f17f55ceef5fd5299c1be497e8","_shasum":"f137cef4e9aba69040c845c17a92241d8e05bc96","author":{"name":"Dhaya Benmessaoud","email":"dhaya.benmessaoud@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dhayab/rpi-profalux-shutters/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"f137cef4e9aba69040c845c17a92241d8e05bc96","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/rpi-profalux-shutters/-/rpi-profalux-shutters-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"dhaya","email":"dhaya.benmessaoud@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-10-15T12:00:08.137Z","created":"2016-10-11T20:06:17.266Z","0.0.1":"2016-10-11T20:06:17.266Z","0.1.0":"2016-10-15T12:00:08.137Z"}}}
