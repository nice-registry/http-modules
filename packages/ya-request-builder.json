manage for proxy because : \n\n- companies sucks\n- need to handle all types of proxies, like https ones\n- and [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) handle it perfectly\n\nSimple in the browser : \n\n- only a facade from XmlHTTPRequest to act the more like  \n- because request handle proxy as environment configuration\n\nAs builder because :\n\n- this pattern is great to instantiate an object for readability\n\nYet another because so much alternatives already exists but no one fully worked :\n\n- [superagent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent) & [superagent proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent-proxy) doesn't make the isomorphic way\n- as it doesn't work on https but probably a but of proxy-agent\n- [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) & [browserify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify) for a simple get has 1.8M bundled (unminified unmangled)\n- [iso-http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iso-http) doesn't handle proxy like it works on bult-in node module http\n\nAll I need to do\n\n- I need two implementations of the request : one with request and the other with XmlHTTPRequest\n- Handle the response as promise because it's better than callbacks\n\n# Browser support \n\n[![Sauce Test
