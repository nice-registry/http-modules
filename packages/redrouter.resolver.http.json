The route records can be created by prefixing the `HTTP::` string to\nthe route,  For example, if I wanted to create an HTTP proxy for \"example.org\":\n\n```\nkey: HTTP::example.org\nvalue:\n{\n  host: \"10.100.1.10\"\n}\n```\n\nIf I would like to proxy certain paths, I can add these to the routes object.  For example,\n\"example.org/animals\" would route to 10.100.1.11, but \"example.org/animals/bear\" would route to 10.100.1.12, but any other path inside of example.org would route to 10.100.1.10:\n\n```\nkey: HTTP::example.org\nvalue:\n{\n  host: \"10.100.1.10\",\n  routes: [\n    {\n      url : \"animals\"\n      host: \"10.100.1.11\"\n    },\n    {\n      url : \"animals/bear\"\n      host: \"10.100.1.12\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIf you dont wish to supply all of these fields, you can establish defaults by passing the same keys into the resolver_ssh options when you create the RedRouter object:\n\n```\nresolvers: [\n  { constructor: resolver_http,\n    options: {\n      defaults: {\n        redirect_https : true\n      }\n    }\n  }\n],\n```\n","created":"2016-08-05T16:30:52.904Z","modified":"2016-08-05T18:27:36.269Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"derektbrown","email":"derek@allderek.com"},"owners":[{"name":"derektbrown","email":"derek@allderek.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"redrouter.resolver.http","_nodeVersion":"6.3.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/redrouter.resolver.http-0.2.1.tgz_1470421654706_0.4560982836410403"},"_npmUser":{"name":"derektbrown","email":"derek@allderek.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.5","_rev":"1-2548447bb152548b3ad21eae756ee528","_shasum":"e233f94c472cb1b7a1ca27f7ca36f70bdefd53bb","author":{"name":"Derek Brown"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/derektbrown/redrouter/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"e233f94c472cb1b7a1ca27f7ca36f70bdefd53bb","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/redrouter.resolver.http/-/redrouter.resolver.http-0.2.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"derektbrown","email":"derek@allderek.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-08-05T18:27:36.269Z","created":"2016-08-05T16:30:52.904Z","0.2.0":"2016-08-05T16:30:52.904Z","0.2.1":"2016-08-05T18:27:36.269Z"}}}
