For instance, you could mount a proxy\ncalled `api` that pointed to `https://api.your-app.com`. Once you've done\nso, a request to e.g. `/__/proxy/api/users.json` would be proxied through to\n`https://api.your-app.com/users.json`.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration for `superstatic-proxy` is an object where the keys are\nreference names for the service to which you're proxying and configuration\ndetails. An example (comments for clarity despite JSON syntax):\n\n```js\n{\n  \"api\": {\n    // the origin of the server to which you want to make requests\n    \"origin\": \"https://api.your-app.com\",\n    \n    // set default headers present on every request. these can be\n    // overridden on individual AJAX requests\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"Accept\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \n    // if true, send the cookies from the static app along to the server\n    \"cookies\": false,\n    \n    // set a timeout for requests sent to the proxy (defaults to 30 seconds)\n    \"timeout\": 30\n  }  \n}\n```","created":"2014-04-28T23:30:11.932Z","modified":"2015-03-05T18:52:50.096Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"scottcorgan","email":"scottcorgan@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"scottcorgan","email":"scottcorgan@gmail.com"},{"name":"mbleigh","email":"michael@intridea.com"},{"name":"collintmiller","email":"collintmiller@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"superstatic-proxy","_nodeVersion":"0.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"scottcorgan","email":"scottcorgan@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.5.1","_rev":"1-8e667df1ac4a535a583319237e7f863f","_shasum":"7b1c4776485124de4eaaedbd0ff093daec384486","author":{"name":"Divshot"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/divshot/superstatic-proxy/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.1.0","1.0.3-rc1":"1.0.3-rc1","1.0.3-rc2":"1.0.3-rc2","1.0.3-rc4":"1.0.3-rc4","1.0.3-rc5":"1.0.3-rc5","1.0.3-rc6":"1.0.3-rc6","1.0.3-rc7":"1.0.3-rc7","1.0.3-rc8":"1.0.3-rc8","1.0.3-rc9":"1.0.3-rc9","1.0.3-rc10":"1.0.3-rc10","1.0.3-rc11":"1.0.3-rc11","1.0.3-rc12":"1.0.3-rc12","1.0.3-rc13":"1.0.3-rc13","1.0.3-rc14":"1.0.3-rc14","1.0.3-rc15":"1.0.3-rc15","1.0.3-rc16":"1.0.3-rc16","1.0.3-rc17":"1.0.3-rc17","1.0.3-rc18":"1.0.3-rc18","1.0.3-rc19":"1.0.3-rc19","2.0.0-rc1":"2.0.0-rc1","2.0.3-rc1":"2.0.3-rc1","2.0.3-rc2":"2.0.3-rc2"},"dist":{"shasum":"7b1c4776485124de4eaaedbd0ff093daec384486","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/superstatic-proxy/-/superstatic-proxy-2.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"scottcorgan","email":"scottcorgan@gmail.com"},{"name":"mbleigh","email":"michael@intridea.com"},{"name":"collintmiller","email":"collintmiller@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-03-05T18:52:50.096Z","created":"2014-04-28T23:30:11.932Z","0.1.0":"2014-04-28T23:30:11.932Z","0.2.0":"2014-05-01T21:33:34.280Z","0.3.0":"2014-05-05T22:39:28.882Z","0.4.0":"2014-05-05T23:01:08.909Z","0.4.1":"2014-05-19T19:08:16.379Z","1.0.0":"2014-10-08T19:46:18.602Z","1.0.1":"2014-10-10T22:59:19.562Z","1.0.2":"2014-10-21T00:54:54.887Z","1.0.3-rc1":"2014-10-21T01:17:09.359Z","1.0.3-rc2":"2014-10-21T01:21:55.859Z","1.0.3-rc4":"2014-10-21T02:23:19.029Z","1.0.3-rc5":"2014-10-21T16:00:48.755Z","1.0.3-rc6":"2014-10-21T16:05:38.718Z","1.0.3-rc7":"2014-10-21T16:09:23.615Z","1.0.3-rc8":"2014-10-21T16:13:32.155Z","1.0.3-rc9":"2014-10-21T16:25:52.949Z","1.0.3-rc10":"2014-10-21T17:00:38.176Z","1.0.3-rc11":"2014-10-21T17:07:35.345Z","1.0.3-rc12":"2014-10-21T17:12:24.659Z","1.0.3-rc13":"2014-10-21T17:18:47.200Z","1.0.3-rc14":"2014-10-21T17:24:09.360Z","1.0.3-rc15":"2014-10-21T17:27:11.019Z","1.0.3-rc16":"2014-10-21T17:36:51.931Z","1.0.3-rc17":"2014-10-21T17:40:10.468Z","1.0.3-rc18":"2014-10-21T17:43:10.200Z","1.0.3-rc19":"2014-10-21T17:47:46.622Z","2.0.0-rc1":"2014-10-21T18:01:29.709Z","2.0.0":"2014-10-21T18:06:59.393Z","2.0.1":"2014-10-21T21:32:58.160Z","2.0.2":"2014-10-21T21:55:30.202Z","2.0.3-rc1":"2014-10-21T22:06:46.226Z","2.0.3-rc2":"2014-10-21T22:19:44.142Z","2.0.3":"2014-10-21T22:40:57.082Z","2.1.0":"2015-03-05T18:52:50.096Z"}}}
