All constructors accept a message as the only argument, otherwise they'll use the default message for that error.  All errors also have a `code` field which is the corresponding HTTP status code as an integer.\n\nE.g.:\n\n```js\nthrow new NotFoundError('widget not found');\n```\n\n## Errors\n\nBelow is the list of error names, status codes and default messages that this package supports.\n\n| Code | Class name | Default message |\n|---|---|---|\n| 400 | `BadRequestError` | There is a problem with the submitted request. |\n| 401 | `NotAuthenticatedError` | You are not authenticated.
