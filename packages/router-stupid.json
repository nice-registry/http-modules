If you want to do your own thing you can give it a callback:\n\n``` js\nroute(req, res, function() {\n\t// no route was matched\n\tres.writeHead(404);\n\tres.end();\n});\n```\n\nYou can also provide a catch-all to a given route that is called if no route was matched:\n\n``` js\nroute.get(function(req, res) {\n\t// called if no other get route matched\n\tres.writeHead(404);\n\tres.end('no GET handler found');\n});\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","created":"2014-09-16T13:11:56.846Z","modified":"2017-04-11T04:40:54.791Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"remy","email":"remy@remysharp.com"},"owners":[{"name":"remy","email":"remy@leftlogic.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"router-stupid","_npmUser":{"name":"remy","email":"remy@remysharp.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.24","_rev":"2-2ff46390059220bb5377e951dc45b3ea","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/remy/router/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Remy Sharp","email":"remy@remysharp.com"},{"name":"Mathias Buus Madsen","email":"m@ge.tt"},{"name":"Ian Jorgensen"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.7.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"2de294ca27ef49d64963d7038436e7e5d6e5c55f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/router-stupid/-/router-stupid-0.7.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"remy","email":"remy@leftlogic.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-11T04:40:54.791Z","created":"2014-09-16T13:11:56.846Z","0.7.0":"2014-09-16T13:11:56.846Z"}}}
