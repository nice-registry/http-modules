Purposefully low on requirements and dependencies, small (and thus hopefully at least ultimately fast) it is also easy to configure, using only standard JSON configuration files.\n\nThis is currently very much alpha in status, only manual testing has been performed so far.\n\nInstallation\n==============\nInstallation can be achieved easily via npm as follows:\n\n```\n$ npm install tdp-http-redirector\n```\n\nPlease note that tdp-http-redirector is really only designed to run on POSIX-style (perhaps with some tweaking) it may run on Windows (though you should note that tdp-http-redirector) is case-sensitive (Windows for the most part is not).\n\nExample usage & configuration\n===============================\n\nEnsure you have [nodejs and npm](http://www.nodejs.org/) installed, cd to your desirted install location then install the NPM module as shown above. \n\nNow open config/options.js and config/redirectRules.js. Configuration should be simple and self-explanatory, each file contains comments and a working config which aside form the redirect rules may well be fine for most uses. \n\nThe following is a guide to content of each config file:\n\n###config/options.js\nThis file contains the main HTTP redirector options e.g. number of worker processes (daemonised mode), IP and port to bind to and HTTP headers to return for matched and unmatched rules.\n\n###config/redirectRules.js\nThis file contains only redirector rules which are a simple JSON obj in the form:\n\n```\n{\n\t\"source-1\":\"destination-1\",\n\t\"source-2\":\"destination-2\",\n\tâ€¦\n\t\"source-n\":\"destination-n\"\n}\n```\n\n###Daemon configuration\nThe daemon is configured in daemonHttpRedirector.js. You should not need to amend this however options can be found in the [documentation for daemonize2](https://npmjs.org/package/daemonize2)\n\n\nUsing tdp-http-redirector\n===========\n####Daemonised mode\nTo start in daemonised mode, cd to your install location and type:\n\n```\n$ node daemon-tdp-http-redirector.js start\n```\n\nYou can stop the daemon similarly:\n\n```\n$ node daemon-tdp-http-redirector.js stop\n```\n\nAnd restarting is achieved by:\n\n```\n$ node daemon-tdp-http-redirector.js restart\n```\n\nFinally, you can check the status (and get the mast process PID) by doing:\n\n```\n$ node daemon-tdp-http-redirector.js status\n```\n\n###\"Normal\" mode (for testing)\nTo use TDP HTTP Redirector in \"normal\" mode, just run:\n\n```\n$ node tdp-http-redirector.js\n```\n\nTo stop the process, just hit ctrl+c\n\n\nChangelog\n===========\n\n### 0.1.0 - 24th August 2012\n- First release \n\nTo do list\n===========\n- Improve/do functional/unit testing etc.\n- Benchmark and improve speed where possible\n- Fix clustering support in daemonised mode\n- Parse & check configuration files before (re)starting\n- More comprehensive worker process management\n- Allow case=insensitivity options for redirect rules\n- Enable a simple method to support HTTPS incoming connections\n- Support for decrypted HTTPS connections to match HTTPS://x.y.x redirect rules\n- Allow redirect rules to be specified in separate includes files e.g. redirectRules/*.js (like e.g. Apache HTTPD mods/sites-available/enabled etc.)\n- Automatic or manual config reload with no downtime (and config checking)\n- Perhaps an admin GUI at some stage\n- Perhaps distributed application support\n\n\nLicense\n=========\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Neil Craig (theDotProduct)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
