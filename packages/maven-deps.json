Allowed values: 'github' [*required*]\n\n**org** - the name of the owner the repository [*required*]\n\n**repo** - the name of the repository [*required*]\n#### Query Parameters ####\n**auth** - the authentication token for a private repository [*optional*]\n\n**committish** - the specific commit number, branch name or tag name [*optional*]\n\n**path** - the path to the root pom.xml file [*optional*]\n\n## Response Format ##\n### On Success ###\nSuccess responses return with HTTP status 200 and the following data:\n```\n{\n  ok: true,\n  errors: [], // array of errors that did not affect this otherwise successful outcome\n  packageVersionFormat: 'mvn:0.0.1',\n  groupId: ...,\n  artifactId: ...,\n  version: ...,\n  name: <artifactId>:<groupId>,\n  packaging: 'pom' | 'jar' | 'war' | ...,\n  dependencies: [...],\n  from: [<artifactId:groupId:version>,...]\n}\n```\n### On Failure ###\nFailure responses return with HTTP status 4xx or 5xx and the following data:\n```\n{\n  ok: false,\n  code: 4xx | 5xx,\n  ... // whatever reason was there for the error to occur\n}\n```\n\n## General Design ##\nMaven-deps is a microservice that does one thing: given a set of input parameters that describe a specific Maven repository (which is assumed to have a `pom.xml` file at the specified path), it introspects the pom.xml file along with all of its sub-modules and dependencies, and returns a formatted response that contains all the dependencies of the project.\n\n## Future Plans ##\nOrdered by priority:\n### Properties ###\nVarious properties can be defined in a single location in the pom.xml file and shared throughout the model. Our main interest is `groupId` and `version` fields that are defined as such properties.\n### Dependency Management ###\nDependency Management is a special section in the pom.xml file that a parent pom can define for all its child pom's to inherit from.\n### Repositories ###\nA pom.xml file can declare repositories where Maven should search for dependencies, after it had failed to find them in the central Maven repository.\n### Semver Ranges ###\nCurrently semver ranges are not supported - Maven-deps only fetches versions that are strictly defined.\n### Plugins ###\nPlugins are people too! Maven plugins are considered 'outside' the production cycle, but we might still want to support them to see whether they are exposed to any security vulnerabilities.\n\n","created":"2017-02-07T18:20:56.574Z","modified":"2017-05-12T12:41:52.680Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"snyk-admin","email":"admin+snyk@snyk.io"},"owners":[{"name":"snyk-admin","email":"admin+snyk@snyk.io"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"maven-deps","_nodeVersion":"6.10.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/maven-deps-3.1.1.tgz_1494592911055_0.3715855262707919"},"_npmUser":{"name":"snyk-admin","email":"admin+snyk@snyk.io"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"32-083ad9f04c290ee931266600480d26f7","_shasum":"839a70ec8cc1f485c8c549877f2d4ca56a96fa39","author":"","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/snyk/maven-deps/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"3.1.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"839a70ec8cc1f485c8c549877f2d4ca56a96fa39","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/maven-deps/-/maven-deps-3.1.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"snyk-admin","email":"admin+snyk@snyk.io"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-12T12:41:52.680Z","created":"2017-02-07T18:20:56.574Z","1.0.0":"2017-02-07T18:20:56.574Z","1.1.0":"2017-02-08T08:25:30.046Z","1.1.1":"2017-02-08T08:36:38.842Z","1.2.0":"2017-02-08T10:05:58.684Z","1.2.1":"2017-02-08T10:38:55.836Z","1.3.0":"2017-02-08T14:09:35.120Z","1.3.1":"2017-02-08T15:17:38.471Z","1.4.0":"2017-02-09T07:43:01.540Z","1.5.0":"2017-02-09T08:22:34.856Z","1.6.0":"2017-02-09T08:28:14.517Z","2.0.0":"2017-02-09T08:29:24.022Z","2.1.0":"2017-02-09T09:53:21.063Z","2.2.0":"2017-02-12T09:35:20.873Z","2.3.0":"2017-02-14T16:13:14.103Z","2.4.0":"2017-02-15T13:35:03.996Z","2.5.0":"2017-02-15T18:52:12.841Z","2.6.0":"2017-02-21T14:37:22.568Z","2.6.1":"2017-02-23T11:13:58.111Z","2.6.2":"2017-02-26T16:09:26.076Z","2.6.3":"2017-02-27T15:29:20.279Z","2.6.4":"2017-03-06T06:04:56.418Z","2.7.0":"2017-03-28T16:08:58.159Z","2.8.0":"2017-03-29T12:52:02.385Z","2.8.1":"2017-03-29T13:18:24.100Z","2.9.0":"2017-04-18T07:23:08.176Z","2.9.1":"2017-04-20T08:57:33.550Z","3.0.0":"2017-04-20T10:07:17.646Z","3.0.1":"2017-04-23T14:37:32.443Z","3.0.2":"2017-04-24T06:56:19.641Z","3.0.3":"2017-04-27T11:50:31.308Z","3.1.0":"2017-04-30T12:24:28.820Z","3.1.1":"2017-05-12T12:41:52.680Z"}}}
