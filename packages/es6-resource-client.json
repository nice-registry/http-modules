Ex. - \n\n`Resource.index('users')`\n\n### Store – store(resource, record)\n\nStore takes a second parameter, an object with the record to be stored. Ex. - \n\n`Resource.store('users', { email: 'daniel@tighten.co' })`\n\n### Show – show(resource, recordId)\n\nShow takes a second parameter, the ID of the associated record. Ex. - \n\n`Resource.show('users', 1)`\n\n### Update – update(resource, record)\n\nUpdate takes a second parameter, an object with the record to be updated. This object must, at a minimum, include the ID of the record in the database. Ex. - \n\n`Resource.update('users', { id: 1, email: 'coulbourne@tighten.co' })`\n\n### Destroy - destroy(resource, id)\n\nDestroy takes a second parameter, the id of the record to be destroyed.\n\n## Tighten Love\n\nThis package is the result of the awesome culture and conversation that happens at [TightenCo](http://tighten.co).
