Each worker of the cluster is responsible to create clients that generate requests. This architecture enables the simulator to scale in really big throughputs. It is suggested to balance the workers over the cores of your system. Create as many workers as your system cores.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n    $ npm install http-traffic-simulator\n\nQuick start\n===========\n    var trafficSimulator = require('http-traffic-simulator');\n    function run(){\n        trafficSimulator.testDuration(5);//-1 for infinite run\n        trafficSimulator.workers(1);\n        trafficSimulator.clients(2)\n        trafficSimulator.throttleRequests_bps(50000);//-1 for no throttling\n        trafficSimulator.randomDelayBetweenRequests('0.5-1.1');\n\n        trafficSimulator.setFunc('request',requestFunc);\n\n        trafficSimulator.start();\n\n        trafficSimulator.events.on('end',function (stats) {\n            console.log(\"Exiting..\");\n            process.exit();\n        });\n    }\n\n    var requestFunc= function(){\n        var options = {};\n        options['host'] = 'www.example.com';\n        options['port'] = '80';\n        options['path'] = '/';\n        options['method'] = 'GET';\n\n        var req=trafficSimulator.request(options,function(response){\n            console.log(\"Response: %s\",response.statusCode);\n            response.setEncoding('utf8');\n            response.on('data',function(chunk){\n                console.log(chunk.length)\n            });\n        });\n    }\n\n    run();\n\n\nFeatures\n========\n* Throttling\n* Clustering\n* Set delay between requests\n* Random or consecutive generation of requests\n* Statistics aggregation\n* Set duration or total number of requests to be executed during the test\n* Utilizing keep-alive-agent module for HTTP connection pooling that re-uses sockets\n\nLicense\n=======\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Ioannis Skitsas iskitsas@gmail.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
