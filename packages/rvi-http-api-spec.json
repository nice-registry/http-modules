To\nview the schema you can visit [this URL](http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartcar/rvi_http_api_spec/master/swagger.yaml#/default)\nor view it locally by following [these instructions](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui).\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is outside the scope of the API specification and is up to the\nimplementation to decide on what authentication to use.\n\n## Response Codes\n\nThe RVI HTTP API uses the following HTTP status codes to communicate the various\nsuccess and error states of requests.\n\nResponse types are defined by standard [HTTP Status Code Definitions](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).\n\nEach non-200 status code returns the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"...\",\n  \"message\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\n+ `error`: the error name which corresponds to the error code it was returned\nwith. (e.g. A `validation_error` corresponds with a HTTP 400)\n+ `message`: a more detailed description of the error\n\n### `HTTP 200` OK\n\nThe request was successful, the corresponding resource will be returned.\n\n### `HTTP 400` Bad Request\n\nThe request was malformed due to either bad syntax, or missing parameters\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"validation_error\",\n  \"message\": \"Invalid or missing request parameters.\"\n}\n```\n\n### `HTTP 401` Unauthorized\n\nThe provided credentials were incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"authentication_error\",\n  \"message\": \"Invalid or expired token provided.\"\n}\n```\n\n### `HTTP 403` Forbidden\n\nThe credentials provided have insufficient permissions to access the\nrequested resource.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"permission_error\",\n  \"message\": \"Insufficient permissions to access requested resource.\"\n}\n```\n\n### `HTTP 404` Not Found\n\nThe requested resource does not exist.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"resource_not_found_error\",\n  \"message\": \"The requested resource was not found.\"\n}\n```\n\n### `HTTP 409` Conflict\n\nThe vehicle is not capable of performing the request in its current state. For\nexample, you cannot open the vehicle's trunk when the vehicle is moving.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"vehicle_state_error\",\n  \"message\": \"Vehicle is not capable of performing request in current state.\"\n}\n```\n\n### `HTTP 429` Too Many Requests\n\nThe application has sent too many requests and must slow down.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"rate_limiting_error\",\n  \"message\": \"The application has sent too many requests and cannot be served due to the application's rate limit being exhausted.\"\n}\n```\n\n### `HTTP 430` Limit Exceeded\n\nThe application has sent exceeded its monthly request limit.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"monthly_limit_exceeded\",\n  \"message\": \"The application has exceeded its monthly limit. Please upgrade the billing plan on the account dashboard.\"\n}\n```\n\n### `HTTP 500` Internal Server Error\n\nThe server unexpectedly had an internal error. This may include failures with\nvehicle to cloud communications.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"server_error\",\n  \"message\": \"Unexpected server error, please try again.\"\n}\n```\n\n\n### `HTTP 501` Not Implemented\n\nThe vehicle is not capable of performing the request. For example, a vehicle\nwithout a sunroof cannot perform an 'open sunroof' command.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"not_capable_error\",\n  \"message\": \"Vehicle is not capable of performing request\"\n}\n```\n","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2016-03-05T01:16:53.261Z"},{"number":"0.0.2","date":"2016-03-09T01:22:55.811Z"},{"number":"0.0.3","date":"2016-03-09T20:16:48.677Z"},{"number":"0.0.4","date":"2016-05-19T15:51:59.647Z"},{"number":"0.0.5","date":"2016-07-11T21:46:24.547Z"}],"created":"2016-03-05T01:16:53.261Z","modified":"2017-03-25T16:42:31.807Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"smartcar","email":"hello@smartcar.com"},"owners":[{"name":"smartcarops","email":"hello@smartcar.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"rvi-http-api-spec","_nodeVersion":"6.3.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/rvi-http-api-spec-0.0.5.tgz_1468273581764_0.1718266315292567"},"_npmUser":{"name":"smartcar","email":"hello@smartcar.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.3","_rev":"2-d710196bdf19f3736eaf52051e2c1c6b","_shasum":"2f18af2af8946ba3486fa287d87039edfcb607b5","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/smartcar/rvi_http_api_spec/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.5"},"dist":{"shasum":"2f18af2af8946ba3486fa287d87039edfcb607b5","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/rvi-http-api-spec/-/rvi-http-api-spec-0.0.5.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"smartcarops","email":"hello@smartcar.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-25T16:42:31.807Z","created":"2016-03-05T01:16:53.261Z","0.0.1":"2016-03-05T01:16:53.261Z","0.0.2":"2016-03-09T01:22:55.811Z","0.0.3":"2016-03-09T20:16:48.677Z","0.0.4":"2016-05-19T15:51:59.647Z","0.0.5":"2016-07-11T21:46:24.547Z"}}}
