Useful for serving up single page applications with frontend routing. You can start the server using the command line..\n\n```\nnpm install http-server-spa -g\n```\n```\nhttp-server-spa <directory> <fallback> <port>\n```\n\nRequests to the server are categorized as one of two types:\n\n## File Request\n\n- A `file` request defined by any request url where last part of the path (after being split by the `/` delimiter) contains a `.` character.\n\nIn the event of a `file` request the server tries to resolve the given path for example `/assets/image.png`. If the file exists then it is sent as a response with the appropriate mime type and a status code of `200`. If the file does not exist however, then the server responds with the status code `404`.\n\n## Route Request\n\n- A `route` request defined by any request that is not a file request.\n\nIn the event of any `route` request, for example `/user/profile`, the server immediately responds with the specified `fallback` file. If the app root (just `/`) is requested then the server responds with the status code `200`. If some other route was requested then the server responds with the status code `301`.\n\n## Frontend Routing\n\nThis approach presumes that your application handles routing on the frontend with javascript. There are many frontend routers out there..\n\n- [aviator](https://github.com/swipely/aviator)\n- [navigo](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo)\n- [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)\n- [ui-router](https://ui-router.github.io/)\n\n..to name a few, but if you prefer to do things yourself a frontend router can be reduced to something a simple as a switch statement that gets evaluated every time the url changes:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.onpopstate = () => {\n  switch (window.location.pathname) {\n    case '/': loadHomePage(); break;\n    case '/profile': loadProfilePage(); break;\n  }\n}\nhistory.pushState(null, null, window.location.pathname);\nwindow.onpopstate();\n```\n","created":"2016-11-23T15:46:44.388Z","modified":"2016-11-24T07:47:11.822Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"lukejacksonn","email":"lukejacksonn@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"lukejacksonn","email":"lukejacksonn@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-server-spa","_nodeVersion":"6.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http-server-spa-1.2.0.tgz_1479973631589_0.9045225358568132"},"_npmUser":{"name":"lukejacksonn","email":"lukejacksonn@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"5-c2417e19a5338d59ed7d2d699f89d645","_shasum":"2553ec4bea38b3ad8de057a38ff43da375779b6a","author":{"name":"Luke Jackson","email":"lukejacksonn@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/lukejacksonn/http-server-spa/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"2553ec4bea38b3ad8de057a38ff43da375779b6a","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-server-spa/-/http-server-spa-1.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"lukejacksonn","email":"lukejacksonn@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-11-24T07:47:11.822Z","created":"2016-11-23T15:46:44.388Z","1.0.0":"2016-11-23T15:46:44.388Z","1.0.1":"2016-11-23T15:52:31.520Z","1.0.2":"2016-11-23T15:55:10.307Z","1.1.0":"2016-11-24T04:50:46.402Z","1.2.0":"2016-11-24T07:47:11.822Z"}}}
