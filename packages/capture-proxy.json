By default the\n                             `accept-encoding` header is removed\n    -v, --verbose            Output requests and responses\n\nCapture is a http proxy that can be used to intercept http requests and\npersist the request and response payloads.\n\n<applicationRoot> is the mounting point for the proxy. (e.g.\nhttp://my.host.com/application/root/)\n```\n\n#### Example\n\n```sh\n# mount http://localhost:3000/\n# save both requests and responses to ./captures folder\n$ capture http://www.google.com/ -p 3000 -R -o ./captures\n```\n\n## Other Commands\n\n### replay\n\nReplay can be used as an alternative to `curl`. It condenses many of the different `curl` options into a [HttpRequest](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html) file.\n\n```\n  Usage: replay <file|alias> [options]\n\n  Options:\n\n    -h, --help      output usage information\n    -H, --headers   Output headers\n    -k, --insecure  Allow connections to SSL sites without valid certs\n    -v, --verbose   Output requests\n```\n\n#### Example\n\nReplay by file\n\n```sh\n# load the contents of ./captures/home.req an re-issue the request\n# ignoring SSL errors\n$ capture replay ./captures/home.req -k\n```\n\nReplay by alias <a name=\"replay_alias\"></a>\n\n```sh\n# load an aliased request named `myAlias` and re-issue it\n$ capture replay myAlias\n```\n\n### alias\n\nSaves a HttpRequest file as an alias that can be later used with the [`replay`](#replay_alias) command\n\n```\n  Usage: alias <alias> <requestFile>\n\n  Options:\n\n    -h, --help  output usage information\n```\n\n#### Example\n\n```sh\n# create the alias `myAlias` for request file ./captures/home.req\n$ capture alias myAlias ./captures/home.req\n```\n\n## Why?\n\nSometimes fiddler isn't an option. This is a very crude and basic alternative to inspecting the requests and responses driven by a personal need to reverse engineer the invokation of SOAP services.\n\n## Issues\n\n* It will handle basic web page requests however static resource references are still a problem\n* Cookie management\n* Redirects\n* Binary data - don't currently know how to handle binary data when it comes to replaying requests\n\n## TODO\n\n* Running the proxy under `https`\n","created":"2014-02-27T14:52:55.275Z","modified":"2017-03-26T10:14:15.754Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"socsieng","email":"socsieng@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"socsieng","email":"socsieng@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"capture-proxy","_nodeVersion":"7.4.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/capture-proxy-0.2.6.tgz_1490523253895_0.5721969292499125"},"_npmUser":{"name":"socsieng","email":"socsieng@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.0.5","_rev":"2-92b8529972765d5616290fdd402409cb","_shasum":"4273a04722be7ee07ea5f6e3770c9de82fc19e53","author":{"name":"socsieng"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/socsieng/capture-proxy/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"4273a04722be7ee07ea5f6e3770c9de82fc19e53","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/capture-proxy/-/capture-proxy-0.2.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"socsieng","email":"socsieng@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-26T10:14:15.754Z","created":"2014-02-27T14:52:55.275Z","0.0.0":"2014-02-27T14:52:57.114Z","0.0.1":"2014-02-27T15:30:36.495Z","0.0.2":"2014-02-27T15:41:52.761Z","0.0.3":"2014-02-27T15:57:18.467Z","0.0.4":"2014-02-27T16:04:36.509Z","0.0.5":"2014-02-27T16:08:24.053Z","0.0.6":"2014-02-27T16:49:52.379Z","0.0.7":"2014-02-28T02:34:58.382Z","0.0.8":"2014-03-01T07:14:44.250Z","0.0.9":"2014-03-01T07:35:54.819Z","0.0.10":"2014-03-01T12:53:05.944Z","0.1.0":"2014-03-01T14:49:27.504Z","0.1.1":"2014-03-01T15:07:13.653Z","0.1.2":"2014-03-01T15:32:11.403Z","0.1.3":"2014-03-02T03:37:56.079Z","0.1.4":"2014-03-02T22:45:04.647Z","0.1.6":"2014-03-05T08:09:06.782Z","0.2.0":"2014-03-05T13:04:57.552Z","0.2.1":"2014-03-05T13:12:49.582Z","0.2.2":"2014-03-06T02:45:29.097Z","0.2.3":"2014-03-06T03:24:36.203Z","0.2.4":"2014-03-09T06:16:30.110Z","0.2.6":"2017-03-26T10:14:15.754Z"}}}
