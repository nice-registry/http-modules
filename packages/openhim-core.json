Install the latest stable [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v4 or greater. The latest [active LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS) is recommended.\n2. Install and start [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) 2.6 or greater.\n3. Install the OpenHIM-core package globally: `npm install openhim-core -g`, this will also install an openhim-core binary to your PATH.\n4. Start the server by executing `openhim-core` from anywhere.\n\nTo make use of your own custom configurations you can copy the [default.json](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-core-js/blob/master/config/default.json) config file and override the default setting:\n\n```\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jembi/openhim-core-js/master/config/default.json\n# edit default.json, then\nopenhim-core --conf=path/to/default.json\n```\n\nFor more information about the config options, [click here](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-core-js/blob/master/config/config.md).\n\n**Note:** one of the first things that you should do once the OpenHIM is up and running is setup a properly signed TLS certificate. You can do this through the [OpenHIM console](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-console) under 'Certificates' on the sidebar.\n\nDeveloper guide\n---------------\n\nYou can use vagrant if you would want to get up and running quickly with a dev environment in a vm. See here to [use Vagrant](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-core-js/wiki/Running-the-OpenHIM-using-Vagrant) to fire up an instance.\n\nClone the `https://github.com/jembi/openhim-core-js.git` repository.\n\nEnsure you have the following installed:\n* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v4 or greater\n* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) (in Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install mongodb`, in OSX using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), run `brew update` followed by `brew install mongodb`)\n\nThe OpenHIM core makes use of the [Koa framework](http://koajs.com/), which requires node version v4 or greater.\n\nThe easiest way to use the latest version of node is to install [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). On Ubuntu, you can install using the install script but you have to add `[[ -s $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh ]] && . $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh # This loads NVM` to the end of your `~/.bashrc` file as well.\n\nOnce `nvm `is installed, run the following:\n\n`nvm install 6`\n\n`nvm alias default 6`\n\nThe latest version of node 4 should now be installed and set as default. The next step is to get all the required dependencies using `npm`. Navigate to the directory where the openhim-core-js source is located and run the following:\n\n`npm install`\n\nThen build the project:\n\n`grunt build`\n\nIn order to run the OpenHIM core server, [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) must be installed and running.\n\nTo run the server, execute:\n\n`npm start` (this runs `grunt build` then `node --harmony lib/server.js` behind the scenes)\n\nThe server will by default start in development mode using the mongodb database 'openhim-development'. To start the serve in production mode use the following:\n\n`NODE_ENV=production node --harmony lib/server.js`\n\nThis starts the server with production defaults, including the use of the production mongodb database called 'openhim'.\n\nThis project uses [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) as a unit testing framework with [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js/) for assertions and [sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/) for spies and mocks. The tests can be run using `npm test`.\n\n**Pro tips:**\n\n* `grunt watch` - will automatically build the project on any changes.\n* `grunt lint` - ensure the code is lint free, this is also run before an `npm test`\n* `npm link` - will symlink you local working directory to the globally installed openhim-core module. Use this so you can use the global openhim-core binary to run your current work in progress. Also, if you build any local changes the server will automatically restart.\n* `npm test -- --mochaGrep=<regex>` - will only run tests with names matching the regex\n* `npm test -- --debugTests` - enabled the node debugger while running unit tests. Add `debugger` statements and use `node debug localhost:5858` to connect to the debugger instance.\n* `npm test -- --bail` - exit on first test failure.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nYou may view/add issues here: https://github.com/jembi/openhim-core-js/issues\n\nTo contibute code, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
