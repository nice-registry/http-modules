Originally written to cache large files for some repetitive operations.\n\nWrites to the cache and serves the large files at the same time (stream copy).\n\nThis cache saves bandwidth not latency.\n\nIt replicates the directory structure the target server, only cached files (which meet or exceed `nBytesMinimumFileSize`).\n\nThe `Content-length` and `Last-modified` headers (from a `HEAD` request to the target server) are used to determine if the cached file is to be invalided. __The `HEAD` request is always made__ and so is depended upon (to proxy updated headers and for immediate cache invalidation).\n\nThere are no plans to add non-ASCII characters support or saving of headers, or 100% independent mirror capabilities.\n\nSo far tested on Windows. Should work without issues on all platforms.\n\n@TODO: write tests, examples, CLI endpoint, etc.\n\nUsage\n=====\n```JavaScript\n\tconst HTTPProxyCache = require(\"http-proxy-cache-lf\");\n\tconst http = require(\"http\");\n\n\tconst httpServer = http.createServer();\n\n\tconst httpProxyCache = new HTTPProxyCache(\n\t\t/*strTargetURLBasePath*/ \"http://kakao.go.ro/\", \n\t\t/*nBytesMinimumFileSize*/ 4 * 1024 * 1024 /*4 MB*/, \n\t\t/*strCacheDirectoryRootPath*/ \"/tmp/repo-cache\"\n\t);\n\n\thttpServer.on(\n\t\t\"request\",\n\t\tasync (incomingMessage, serverResponse) => {\n\t\t\tawait httpProxyCache.processHTTPRequest(incomingMessage, serverResponse);\n\t\t}\n\t);\n\n\thttpServer.listen(8008, \"127.0.0.1\");\n```\n","created":"2017-04-03T23:02:44.951Z","modified":"2017-04-09T12:29:15.857Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"oxygens","email":"ionut.stan@bigstep.com"},"owners":[{"name":"oxygens","email":"ionut.stan@bigstep.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-proxy-cache-lf","_nodeVersion":"7.8.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http-proxy-cache-lf-0.3.1.tgz_1491740955164_0.31182860117405653"},"_npmUser":{"name":"oxygens","email":"ionut.stan@bigstep.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.2.0","_rev":"5-0bf546dce0f84b53076f385bffd26a76","_shasum":"d7cd4fe104ba87cb633ba902dc2bc7eae6ed7ac7","author":{"name":"Ionut Stan","email":"Ionut.Stan@bigstep.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/oxygens/CachedPassthroughMirror/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Ionut Stan","email":"Ionut.Stan@bigstep.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"d7cd4fe104ba87cb633ba902dc2bc7eae6ed7ac7","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/http-proxy-cache-lf/-/http-proxy-cache-lf-0.3.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"oxygens","email":"ionut.stan@bigstep.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-09T12:29:15.857Z","created":"2017-04-03T23:02:44.951Z","0.1.0":"2017-04-03T23:02:44.951Z","0.1.1":"2017-04-03T23:13:37.604Z","0.2.0":"2017-04-04T00:16:15.572Z","0.3.0":"2017-04-09T12:27:41.526Z","0.3.1":"2017-04-09T12:29:15.857Z"}}}
