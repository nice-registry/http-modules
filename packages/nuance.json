If you receive error 500 with AUDIO_INFO - the headers you sent are probably wrong.\r\n2. Please make sure you are sending the right headers with the right language.\r\n3. Feel free to modify the default dictationHeaders in the nuance.js file, at the moment they are set to handle AMR files.\r\n4. You may also replace the default dictationHeaders by suppling additionalHeaders in the sendDictationRequest options, so you don't have to change the default headers in the nuance.js file.","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-08-09T13:09:25.045Z","modified":"2017-01-31T13:31:20.795Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"eladc","email":"elad.metal@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"eladc","email":"elad.metal@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"nuance","_nodeVersion":"6.9.4","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/nuance-1.1.1.tgz_1485869480118_0.025290871504694223"},"_npmUser":{"name":"eladc","email":"elad.metal@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"2-a30c532c2253cba53eaaffce3cd2eef7","_shasum":"6a134df54606b80a0db2f30505399483043982e3","author":{"name":"Elad Cohen","email":"elad.metal@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/eladcn/nuance-nodejs/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"6a134df54606b80a0db2f30505399483043982e3","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/nuance/-/nuance-1.1.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"eladc","email":"elad.metal@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-31T13:31:20.795Z","created":"2015-08-09T13:09:25.045Z","1.0.0":"2015-08-09T13:09:25.045Z","1.0.1":"2015-08-27T14:39:13.227Z","1.1.0":"2016-08-25T14:08:18.055Z","1.1.1":"2017-01-31T13:31:20.795Z"},"users":{"bipiane":true}}}
