Since we will be accessing the server using ssh the server can bind to a port that is not open externally.\nOn your local machine you just create the agent with some ssh options and pass it to a http module.\n\n### Using node core\n\n``` js\nvar http = require('http')\nvar agent = require('http-ssh-agent')\n\n// per default the agent will authenticate using ~/.ssh/id_rsa as your private key\nvar ssh = agent('username@example.com')\n\nhttp.get({\n  port: 8080,        // assuming the remote server is running on port 8080\n  host: '127.0.0.1', // the host is resolved via ssh so 127.0.0.1 -> example.com\n  agent: ssh         // simply pass the agent\n}, function(response) {\n  response.pipe(process.stdout)\n})\n```\n\n### Using request\n\n``` js\nvar request = require('request')\n\nrequest('http://127.0.0.1:8080', {agent: ssh}).pipe(process.stdout)\n```\n\n### SSH options\n\nPass additional ssh options as the second argument. See [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2) connection options for a full list of available options.\n\n``` js\nvar ssh = agent('username@example.com', {\n  privateKey: 'path-to-private-key', // can also be a buffer,\n  password: 'ssh-password'    // specify a password instead of a key\n})\n```\n\n### Host verification\n\nThe agent will emit a `verify` event when it wants you to verify a host fingerprint.\nYou should validate that the fingerprint is correct and return an error if not.\n\n``` js\nssh.on('verify', function(fingerprint, callback) {\n  console.log('Server fingerprint is', fingerprint)\n  callback() // pass an error to indicate a bad fingerprint\n})\n```\n\nIf you do not want to do host validation simply do not listen for the `verify` event.\nYou can also choose to pass the hash to challange against as the `verify` option.\n\n## Running the tests\n\nTo run the tests you need to have a local ssh server running (on OSX enable `Remote login`) and have your own public key\nwhitelisted in `.ssh/authorized_keys`.\n\nThen simply run\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2014-01-07T22:34:57.566Z","modified":"2015-02-18T13:19:03.480Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-ssh-agent","_nodeVersion":"1.2.0","_npmUser":{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.5.1","_rev":"1-deae10e150fc525cd6b39d30b4e6cfd3","_shasum":"17e9d65aea48d4b9065669a79e8911740b246e66","author":{"name":"Mathias Buus","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mafintosh/http-ssh-agent/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"17e9d65aea48d4b9065669a79e8911740b246e66","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-ssh-agent/-/http-ssh-agent-1.0.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-02-18T13:19:03.480Z","created":"2014-01-07T22:34:57.566Z","0.1.0":"2014-01-07T22:35:00.060Z","0.1.1":"2014-01-08T00:21:05.427Z","0.1.2":"2014-01-08T01:35:47.107Z","0.1.3":"2014-01-08T01:46:07.870Z","0.1.4":"2014-01-08T09:05:39.074Z","0.2.0":"2014-01-10T03:05:01.266Z","0.2.1":"2014-01-11T17:47:40.790Z","0.2.2":"2014-01-11T18:11:48.687Z","0.2.3":"2014-01-11T18:25:25.792Z","0.2.4":"2014-01-12T02:36:04.052Z","0.2.5":"2014-01-13T22:27:20.194Z","0.2.6":"2014-01-13T23:42:40.798Z","0.3.0":"2014-01-16T14:14:36.386Z","0.3.1":"2014-01-16T15:00:58.027Z","0.3.2":"2014-01-16T20:50:57.197Z","0.3.3":"2014-01-16T21:59:03.920Z","0.3.4":"2014-01-16T22:26:17.771Z","0.3.5":"2014-01-17T09:06:44.908Z","0.3.6":"2014-01-21T15:21:08.955Z","0.3.7":"2014-01-25T20:28:04.528Z","0.3.8":"2014-03-29T07:00:39.220Z","1.0.0":"2014-10-09T03:53:02.685Z","1.0.1":"2015-02-11T18:47:24.483Z","1.0.2":"2015-02-11T19:36:39.237Z","1.0.3":"2015-02-18T09:44:15.613Z","1.0.4":"2015-02-18T13:19:03.480Z"},"users":{"fgribreau":true}}}
