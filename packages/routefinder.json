This is because rather than looping through a large array of regular expressions calling each of them until a match, Routefinder breaks down the route and walks the tree for a matching route.\n\nThis is currently pre-minor release and could be subject to change and will continue to be develop over the next few weeks.\n\n## Usage:\n```javascript\nvar router = new require('routefinder').Router()\n\nrouter.get('/my-route', function (req, res) {\n  // do something\n  res.statusCode = 200\n  res.end('OK!')\n})\n\nrequire('http')\n  .createServer(router.handle)\n  .listen(8080)\n```\n\n## Planned features\nI am planning to add capabilities so this can easily be added as router to express which will then be used under-the-hood by express instead of it's own router.\n","created":"2014-09-28T20:38:53.109Z","modified":"2015-05-24T17:52:29.453Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"sonewman","email":"newmansam@outlook.com"},"owners":[{"name":"sonewman","email":"newmansam@outlook.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"routefinder","_nodeVersion":"2.0.2","_npmUser":{"name":"sonewman","email":"newmansam@outlook.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.9.0","_rev":"1-6e16fe96fc59353e88ef84a241789362","_shasum":"c8085f8a41b14716d42b89c1da24256ce6d57f55","author":{"name":"Sam Newman"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sonewman/routefinder/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"c8085f8a41b14716d42b89c1da24256ce6d57f55","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/routefinder/-/routefinder-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"sonewman","email":"newmansam@outlook.com"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.md","time":{"modified":"2015-05-24T17:52:29.453Z","created":"2014-09-28T20:38:53.109Z","0.2.0-0":"2014-09-28T20:38:53.109Z","1.0.0":"2015-05-24T02:49:54.127Z","1.0.1":"2015-05-24T17:52:29.453Z"}}}
