First configuration is as simple as running `rdb_init` from the command line.\n\n#### Configuration Variables\n\n_dataDir_ - location of where `stores` will be written.\n\n_userDir_ - location of where the user database will be written.\n\n_token.secret_ - secret for JWT token\n\n_token.expiration_ - default expiration\n\n_cookie.password_ - cookie password\n\n_cookie.name_ - name of the cookie\n\n_server.host_ - host to listen on\n\n_server.port_ - port to listen on\n\n_public_ - whether a public website should be available\n\n_user_ - user to drop priviledges to if run by root\n\n\n\n## RESTful Interface\n\nThe RESTful interface requires a valid Bearer token delivered as part of the request in order to access.\n\nThis Bearer token is delivered as part of the request headers:\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN\n```\n\n### GET /database\n\nReturns basic information about the database.\n\n_Returns:_\n\n```\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\",\n  \"name\": \"http-db\",\n  \"version\": \"0.5.0\",\n  \"port\": 8765,\n  \"host\": \"localhost\",\n  \"hostname\":\"localhost\"\n}\n```\n\n### GET /database/stores\n\nReturns a list of `stores` that you have access to.\n\n_Returns:_\n\n```\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\",\n  \"stores\": [\n    \"store1\",\n    \"store2\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### GET /database/value/{store}/{id}\n\nFor a given a `store` and `id, returns the value associated with it.\n\n_Returns:_\n\n```\n{\n  \"foo\": \"bar\"\n}\n```\n\n### POST /database/value/{store}/{id}\n\nSets the `JSON` value passed as part of the body in the `store` and assigns it to the `key`.  This operation overwrites any existing value.\n\nThis requires a `Content-type` header to be set on the request:\n\n```\nContent-type: application/json\n```\n\n_Returns:_\n\n`400` on Error, with `JSON` error message:\n\n```\n{\n  \"status\": \"error\",\n  \"error\": \"payload should be JSON\"\n}\n```\n\n`201` on Success\n\n### DELETE /database/value/{store}/{id}\n\nDeletes an entry for a `store`.\n\n_Returns:_\n\n```\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\"\n}\n```\n\n### GET /database/keys/{store}\n\n\n### GET /database/all/{store}\n\n### GET /database/filter/{store}?key={key}&value={value}\n\n### POST /database/query/{store}\n","created":"2014-09-28T22:01:10.996Z","modified":"2015-03-29T13:46:10.330Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jerrysievert","email":"code@legitimatesounding.com"},"owners":[{"name":"jerrysievert","email":"code@legitimatesounding.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-db","_nodeVersion":"1.4.1","_npmUser":{"name":"jerrysievert","email":"code@legitimatesounding.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.6.0","_rev":"1-406dfd9c260f8cef4b5450b0c22137f4","_shasum":"116d1e7e31a4c6ce8b8511b79aaaeb8a14fe72c1","author":{"name":"Jerry Sievert"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.8"},"dist":{"shasum":"116d1e7e31a4c6ce8b8511b79aaaeb8a14fe72c1","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-db/-/http-db-0.5.8.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jerrysievert","email":"code@legitimatesounding.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-03-29T13:46:10.330Z","created":"2014-09-28T22:01:10.996Z","0.5.1":"2014-09-28T22:01:10.996Z","0.5.2":"2014-10-10T00:48:55.669Z","0.5.3":"2014-10-31T03:18:36.194Z","0.5.4":"2014-10-31T03:22:13.813Z","0.5.5":"2014-10-31T03:24:00.234Z","0.5.6":"2014-10-31T23:13:10.991Z","0.5.7":"2014-10-31T23:23:32.273Z","0.5.8":"2015-03-29T13:46:10.330Z"}}}
