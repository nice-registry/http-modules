Additional hardware required.\nThis is a modified version of the https://github.com/metbosch/homebridge-http-temperature plugin.\nThis version only supports the light sensor.\n\n# Installation\n\n1. Install homebridge using: npm install -g homebridge\n2. Install this plugin using: npm install -g homebridge-http-lux\n3. Update your configuration file. See sample-config.json in this repository for a sample.\n\n# Configuration\n\n\nConfiguration sample file:\n\n ```\n \"accessories\": [\n     {\n         \"accessory\": \"HttpLux\",\n         \"name\": \"Ambient Light Level\",\n         \"url\": \"http://192.168.0.20/lightlevel?format=json\",\n         \"http_method\": \"GET\"\n     }\n ]\n\n```\n\n\nThe defined endpoint will return a json looking like this\n```\n{\n\t\"lightlevel\": 150\n}\n```\n\n\nThis plugin acts as an interface between a web endpoint and homebridge. You will need additional hardware to expose the web endpoints with the light level information. I built my Temperature, Humidity and Light Sensor on the NodeMCU board with Arduino IDE.\n","created":"2017-01-12T09:31:41.175Z","modified":"2017-01-14T06:22:27.450Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"crashtestoz","email":"projects@candco.com.au"},"owners":[{"name":"crashtestoz","email":"projects@candco.com.au"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"homebridge-http-lux","_nodeVersion":"7.1.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/homebridge-http-lux-0.8.0.tgz_1484374945638_0.6189968807157129"},"_npmUser":{"name":"crashtestoz","email":"projects@candco.com.au"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.9","_rev":"8-c85e2528290241d0767c0f387957ce5c","_shasum":"ddfac3df91c0c1306fe6568d60ca5b202bc28cdd","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/crashtestoz/homebridge-http-lux/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.8.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"ddfac3df91c0c1306fe6568d60ca5b202bc28cdd","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/homebridge-http-lux/-/homebridge-http-lux-0.8.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"crashtestoz","email":"projects@candco.com.au"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-14T06:22:27.450Z","created":"2017-01-12T09:31:41.175Z","0.1.0":"2017-01-12T09:31:41.175Z","0.2.0":"2017-01-12T10:05:19.610Z","0.3.0":"2017-01-12T10:25:19.318Z","0.4.0":"2017-01-14T01:13:13.952Z","0.5.0":"2017-01-14T01:14:49.561Z","0.6.0":"2017-01-14T01:20:52.859Z","0.7.0":"2017-01-14T01:42:22.371Z","0.8.0":"2017-01-14T06:22:27.450Z"}}}
