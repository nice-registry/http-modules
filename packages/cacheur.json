It is built with modularity and simplicity in mind.\n\n> This application should work stable enough, but is still in heavy development.\n\n## Install\n\n### Install globally\n```bash\n$ npm install -g cacheur\n```\n\n## Usage\n### Run cacheur\n```bash\n# Within the project dir cacheur can be called directly:\ncacheur\n\n# It is possible to manually set the project directory:\ncacheur --dir \"/C/Dropbox/Software Projekte/cbmodel/caches/\"\n```\n\n### Set up project\ncacheur excepts a project directory that contains config files, containing the specific job settings and a project wide global `_setting.yaml` file.\n\n\n### Example Jobs\nSee: [/examples](/examples)\n\n#### Cache an generic JSON API\n```yaml\nhttp:\n  url: https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues\n  queryString:\n    state: open\n```\nThis will make a http request to the GitHub API at given url and cache the result. The optional queryString object may contain URL parameters. In this case ?state=open will be appended to the url. The cache will be updated every 10 seconds. \n\n#### Fetch a CSV file \n```yaml\ncacheExpiration: 360\ntimeout: 180\nretryDelay: 30\n\nhttp:\n  url: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/5b3a-rs48/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD\n```\nThis fetches a bigger CSV file from, renews the cache every 360 seconds. It will wait 180 seconds before timeout (this might however be shortened by your network settings). If the request fails, cacheur will retry after 30 seconds.\n\n#### Cache an SemanticMediaWiki ASK Query\n\n## Roadmap\n* Transform data formats (CSV to JSON object)\n* Support JSON Path Queries though an ?q=<query> param\n\n## Run cacheur as a linux service\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Simon Heimler](http://www.fannon.de)\n\n[npm-image]: https://badge.fury.io/js/cacheur.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/cacheur\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/Fannon/cacheur.svg?branch=master\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/Fannon/cacheur\n[daviddm-image]: https://david-dm.org/Fannon/cacheur.svg?theme=shields.io\n[daviddm-url]: https://david-dm.org/Fannon/cacheur\n","created":"2015-04-24T04:27:11.626Z","modified":"2015-08-07T08:55:57.378Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"fannon","email":"heimlersimon@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"fannon","email":"heimlersimon@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"cacheur","_nodeVersion":"0.12.7","_npmUser":{"name":"fannon","email":"heimlersimon@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.7.1","_rev":"1-5dcda500b8329b06831d8b5e77041d93","_shasum":"6d3b0483c65a154563015f6ceca5c2cd78c82c69","author":{"name":"Simon Heimler","email":"heimlersimon@gmail.com","url":"http://www.fannon.de"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Fannon/cacheur/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.6.13"},"dist":{"shasum":"6d3b0483c65a154563015f6ceca5c2cd78c82c69","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/cacheur/-/cacheur-0.6.13.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"fannon","email":"heimlersimon@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-08-07T08:55:57.378Z","created":"2015-04-24T04:27:11.626Z","0.2.5":"2015-04-24T04:27:11.626Z","0.2.6":"2015-04-24T04:52:06.239Z","0.3.0":"2015-04-24T05:11:34.343Z","0.3.1":"2015-04-24T08:04:02.253Z","0.3.2":"2015-04-25T05:29:15.702Z","0.3.3":"2015-04-27T06:17:27.484Z","0.3.5":"2015-05-04T09:08:52.693Z","0.3.6":"2015-05-04T10:48:50.026Z","0.3.7":"2015-05-04T16:54:33.914Z","0.4.0":"2015-05-18T08:26:29.259Z","0.5.0":"2015-07-02T06:05:29.210Z","0.6.0":"2015-07-24T12:42:35.706Z","0.6.1":"2015-07-28T09:39:21.373Z","0.6.2":"2015-07-28T09:43:44.214Z","0.6.3":"2015-08-04T08:40:15.741Z","0.6.4":"2015-08-04T08:55:35.733Z","0.6.5":"2015-08-04T12:31:06.783Z","0.6.6":"2015-08-04T13:15:12.281Z","0.6.7":"2015-08-06T13:35:43.732Z","0.6.8":"2015-08-06T14:01:45.939Z","0.6.9":"2015-08-07T06:53:45.860Z","0.6.10":"2015-08-07T08:11:30.085Z","0.6.11":"2015-08-07T08:26:19.879Z","0.6.12":"2015-08-07T08:34:59.323Z","0.6.13":"2015-08-07T08:55:57.378Z"}}}
