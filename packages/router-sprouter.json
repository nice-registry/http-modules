For example:\n\n```\nfunction upload() {\n    /* put handler functionality here */\n}\n```\n\nThen, register your handlers with the router via the Router.setRoute() method.\n\n## Redirection:\n\nThe router allows you to register redirections for any incoming urls with the setRedirect() method. You can also set a redirection status of either 301 or 302. When the router detects that an incoming request is pointed at a redirected url, it will automatically re-point the url to the correct request handler.\n\nBe sure to have set up a route handler (via setRoutes()) for your redirection url, otherwise setting a redirect will result in a 404 error.\n\nYou can check if a url has a registered redirect with the getRedirect() method.\n\n## Response writeHead:\n\nInstead of writing out response.WriteHead like so,\n\n```\nmyRouter.get('/awesome', function(req, res){\n**res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});**\n  res.write('wow, so awesome, such router');\n  res.end();\n});\n```\nsimply include in the resWriteHead function.\n```\nmyRouter.get('/awesome', function(req, res){\n**resWriteHead(200, 'text/plain');**\n  res.write('wow, so awesome, such router');\n  res.end();\n});\n```\n\n## Logging:\n\nRouter Sprouter contains a couple helpful methods to auto-generate logs with each request and response.  The logs generated will be stored (somewhat inconveniently) in your node_modules/router-sprouter/lib/log/ folder.  (Future versions will allow for custom log folder configuration)  You must implicitly call logger.logReq(req) at the point at which you want to log the request/response.  For example, to log the req and res from the above function, insert the following two lines of code:\n\n```\nmyRouter.get('/awesome', function(req, res){\n**logger.logReq(req);**\n  resWriteHead(200, 'text/plain');\n  res.write('wow, so awesome, such router');\n  res.end();\n**logger.logRes(res);**\n});\n```\n\nIt can also clear each log folder upon the following function call:\n\n```\n// Clear request logs folder\nlogger.clearReqLogs();\n\n// Clear response logs folder\nlogger.clearResLogs();\n```\n\n## Functions:\n\n   + Basic Router\n\n        Router.setRoute(method, route, handler);\n\n        Router.getRoute(req, res);\n\n   + Url Request/Response Logger\n\n        Logger.logReq(req);\n\n        Logger.logRes(res);\n\n        Logger.clearResLogs();\n\n        Logger.clearReqLogs();\n\n\n   + Redirect Support\n\n        Router.setRedirect(url, redirect, type);\n\n        Router.getRedirect(url);\n\n\n   + Response writeHead encapsulation\n\n        resWriteHead(status code, 'MIME-type');\n\n\n## License: MIT\n\nCopyright (c) <2015> <David Vicklund, Ryan Heathers, Jack Sneed>\n\n\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
