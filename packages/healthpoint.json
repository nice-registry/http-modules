This is useful for adding things like your app's version.\n\n`check` is a function that will be called with a callback. If the callback is called with an error as its argument, the health check JSON will have a 500 statusCode and will display `status: 'Error'`.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","created":"2017-02-03T07:10:10.683Z","modified":"2017-02-03T07:10:10.683Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"dguttman","email":"david@davidguttman.com"},"owners":[{"name":"dguttman","email":"david@davidguttman.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"healthpoint","_nodeVersion":"6.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/healthpoint-1.0.0.tgz_1486105809985_0.4941353271715343"},"_npmUser":{"name":"dguttman","email":"david@davidguttman.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"1-c213b23ef129ff50eeebce23c23a6367","_shasum":"eba8cc64e9404c0b103fc454a17622a862af71cf","author":{"name":"David Guttman","email":"david@guttman.io","url":"http://davidguttman.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/davidguttman/healthpoint/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"eba8cc64e9404c0b103fc454a17622a862af71cf","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/healthpoint/-/healthpoint-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"dguttman","email":"david@davidguttman.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-02-03T07:10:10.683Z","created":"2017-02-03T07:10:10.683Z","1.0.0":"2017-02-03T07:10:10.683Z"}}}
