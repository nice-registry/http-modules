Create a Heroku app\n1. Install `auth-static` via NPM\n1. Create the server\n1. Tell Heroku to run the server\n1. Set up the config variables in the Heroku Dashboard\n1. Commit your changes\n1. Push your code to Heroku\n1. Test your app\n\n### In more detail\n\n#### 1. Create a Heroku app\n\n`heroku create your-app-name`\n\nReplace `your-app-name` with whatever you want your app to be called. This example would result in the app being available at <https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/>.\n\n#### 2. Install `auth-static` via NPM\n\n`npm install --save auth-static`\n\n#### 3. Create the server\n\n```\n// index.js\n\nvar server = require('auth-static')\n\nserver({\n\toptions: {\n\t    cache: 3600,\n\t    gzip: true\n\t},\n\tpassword: process.env.PASSWORD,\n\tport: 1234,\n\trealm: 'Private',\n\troot: './example',\n\tusername: process.env.USERNAME\n})\n```\n\n### 4. Tell Heroku to run the server\n\nThe Procfile tells Heroku what to do once it's installed your project.\n\nWe want Heroku to run the server that lives in `index.js`:\n\n```\n// Procfile\n\nweb: node index.js\n```\n\n#### 5. Set up the config variables in the Heroku Dashboard\n\nVisit <https://dashboard.herokuapp.com/>, navigate to the settings page for your app and edit the config variables. We need to create pairs for `NODE_ENV`, `USERNAME`, and `PASSWORD`. `NODE_ENV` needs a value of `productio` for everything to work, whereas the the other two can be whatever you want.\n\n#### 6. Commit your changes\n\n`git commit -m \"Setting up auth-static\"`\n\n#### 7. Push your code to Heroku\n\n`git push master heroku`\n\n#### 8. Test your app\n\nRunning `heroku open` will open your app (e.g. <https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/>) in your browser of choice. If everything has worked, you will be presented with a basic auth form; enter your username and passowrd and you'll be able to see your static content.\n","created":"2015-05-24T17:46:39.227Z","modified":"2016-05-30T18:59:40.110Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"dennisimo","email":"andy@dennisimo.com"},"owners":[{"name":"dennisimo","email":"andy@dennisimo.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"auth-static","_nodeVersion":"4.1.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/auth-static-1.0.3.tgz_1464634777996_0.8269359795376658"},"_npmUser":{"name":"dennisimo","email":"andy@dennisimo.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.4","_rev":"1-2f2a6d1a827ef1312cd2f91d35abaa40","_shasum":"51ff879d4531f737d92ff5ca96da9d70963ca4c9","author":{"name":"Andy Dennis"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dennisimo/auth-static/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"51ff879d4531f737d92ff5ca96da9d70963ca4c9","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/auth-static/-/auth-static-1.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"dennisimo","email":"andy@dennisimo.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-05-30T18:59:40.110Z","created":"2015-05-24T17:46:39.227Z","1.0.0":"2015-05-24T17:46:39.227Z","1.0.1":"2015-05-24T17:53:11.557Z","1.0.2":"2015-05-24T19:05:38.595Z","1.0.3":"2016-05-30T18:59:40.110Z"}}}
