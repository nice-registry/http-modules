Close the server when there's an\n  error, so that it stops accepting requests.  This is handy when\n  running as part of a cluster, so that unknown-state processes can be\n  cleaned up and replaced.\n* `enter` Boolean, default=true.  Enter the domain immediately, so\n  that errors thrown in the server's request handler will be caught.\n* `exit` Boolean, default=true. Exit the domain when there's an error.\n* `callback` Function.  A function that will be called when an error\n  occurs.\n\nAlso, if the response has an `error` member which is a function, then\nit'll call that when there's an error.\n\nIf there's no `res.error` method, and there's no `callback` option,\nthen it'll throw the error.\n\n## Methods\n\n* `dhs(req, res, options, next)`  Attach the domain to the request and\n  response.  Options object is optional.  `next` callback is there for\n  the benefit of express-style middleware usage.\n* `dhs.defaults(options)` Return a dhs function that'll use the\n  supplied options.\n","created":"2012-11-16T08:54:17.185Z","modified":"2014-08-08T04:11:59.744Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"isaacs","email":"i@izs.me"},"owners":[{"name":"isaacs","email":"i@izs.me"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"domain-http-server","_npmUser":{"name":"isaacs","email":"i@izs.me"},"_npmVersion":"2.0.0-alpha-5","_rev":"1-416d70040805f6365d813bc1946229ef","_shasum":"ccaab65af5f9c9ad230c4067f552c155f53b3007","author":{"name":"Isaac Z.
