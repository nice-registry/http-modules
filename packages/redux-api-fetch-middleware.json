Check [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=fetch) if the browsers you have to support have the Fetch API. If they don't you have to include a polyfill by yourself, e.g. [isomorphic-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-fetch) or the [Github fetch polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch).\nThe fetchMiddleware expects a **JSON response**. Any other response formats will result in an error.\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst you have to register redux-api-fetch-middleware as a middleware to redux:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createStore } from 'redux';\nimport fetchMiddleware from 'redux-api-fetch-middleware';\n\nimport reducer from './your-reducers';\n\nlet store = createStore(reducer, ['Initial State'], fetchMiddleware);\n```\n\nAfter registering you can use it anywhere when dispatching an action:\n\n```javascript\nimport { FETCH } from 'redux-api-fetch-middleware';\n\ndispatch({\n  type: FETCH,\n  payload: {\n    types: [\"REQUEST\", \"SUCCESS\", \"FAIL\"],\n    endpoint: '/your/api/endpoint'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAdditionally you can pass the following in the **action** object:\n\n- **meta**: An object containing meta data. This information isn't processed by the fetchMiddleware but instead it is passed through when dispatching any of the 3 action types.\n\nAnd the following is for the **payload** object:\n\n- **method**: The HTTP method to use. Defaults to \"GET\". When using a method like \"POST\" you might want to pass data in the **body** property.\n- **body**: An object containing data to be sent to the server.\n\nThe fetchMiddleware has the header `credentials` set by default with a value of `same-origin` which means it is sending cookies and session data to the server.\n\n## Format of triggered actions\n\nThe fetchMiddleware dispatches the 3 actions passed in payload.types:\n\n- **REQUEST**: This action is dispatched before the request is started. The action object looks like this: `{ type: payload.types[0] }`.\n- **SUCCESS**: When the HTTP request was successful. The action object looks like this: `{ type: payload.types[1], payload: result, meta: meta }`.\n- **FAIL**: When the HTTP request failed. Format of the action object: `{ type: payload.types[2], payload: { message: error }, error: true, meta: meta }`\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Sammy Braun, licensed under MIT (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE))\n","created":"2016-07-29T08:10:47.807Z","modified":"2016-07-29T08:15:55.448Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"siggysamson","email":"braun.sammy@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"siggysamson","email":"braun.sammy@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"redux-api-fetch-middleware","_nodeVersion":"5.0.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/redux-api-fetch-middleware-1.0.2.tgz_1469780152712_0.9406628231517971"},"_npmUser":{"name":"siggysamson","email":"braun.sammy@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.3.6","_rev":"1-2d9b186f00d54f3230976857a743eb12","_shasum":"5d7a571febc802e727cd4c8e83a07df6043acef2","author":{"name":"Sammy Braun"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/siggysamson/redux-fetch-middleware/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"5d7a571febc802e727cd4c8e83a07df6043acef2","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/redux-api-fetch-middleware/-/redux-api-fetch-middleware-1.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"siggysamson","email":"braun.sammy@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-07-29T08:15:55.448Z","created":"2016-07-29T08:10:47.807Z","1.0.0":"2016-07-29T08:10:47.807Z","1.0.2":"2016-07-29T08:15:55.448Z"}}}
