Parameters in the callback\r\nare the model and the request response.\r\n\r\n### .execute( \"command name\" )\r\n\r\nIf you're using the '_commands' functionality, calling `.execute` will seralise the command's properties and PUT/POST/DELETE etc to the specified HREF. \r\n\r\nHTTP error codes 201, 200 and 202 are considered successful. ANything else counts as an error. \r\nOn success, a .fetch() automatically happens. If it's an error this doesn't happen. \r\n\r\nIt will also trigger `executed` or `execution-failed` which is passed the command that failed. This should bubble up to the parent model.\r\n\r\n### .execute( \"command name\", callback )\r\n\r\nIf you pass a callback, instead of an automatic .fetch() happening your callback is called so you can manually decide whether or not to resync.\r\n\r\nThe parameters passed to the callback are `err` and `response`. 201, 200 and 202 are considered successful. ANything else counts as an error.\r\n\r\nIt will also trigger `executed` or `execution-failed`, which is passed the command that failed.\r\n\r\nAnd this gives you Halogen Models with the HTTP extensions. This module is badly named really. This should bubble up to the parent model.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n  MIT\r\n","created":"2014-07-13T12:59:05.039Z","modified":"2014-07-13T12:59:07.293Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"charlottegore","email":"conspiracygore@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"charlottegore","email":"conspiracygore@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"halogen-resource","_npmUser":{"name":"charlottegore","email":"conspiracygore@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.11","_rev":"1-0d17f3222cf5d69a942527ba31fe4ad1","author":{"name":"template"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/halogenjs/resource/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"fd260345f1f74df5f3814380b0208ffbc2841cc0","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/halogen-resource/-/halogen-resource-1.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"charlottegore","email":"conspiracygore@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"Readme.md","time":{"modified":"2014-07-13T12:59:07.293Z","created":"2014-07-13T12:59:05.039Z","1.0.2":"2014-07-13T12:59:07.293Z"}}}
