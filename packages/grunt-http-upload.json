Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt grunt-http-upload --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-http-upload');\n```\n\n## The \"http_upload\" task\n\n### Overview\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `http_upload` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n\n  http_upload: {\n    your_target: {\n      options: {\n        url: 'http://example.com/template/123/?token=<%= config.apiKey %>',\n        method: 'PUT',\n        rejectUnauthorized: false,\n        headers: {\n          'Authorization': 'Token <%= your_token_here %>'\n        },\n        data: {\n          someKey: 'some value'\n        },\n        onComplete: function(data) {\n            console.log('Response: ' + data);\n        }\n      },\n      src: '<%= yeoman.dist %>/dist.zip',\n      dest: 'myField'\n    },\n  },\n\n})\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### options.url\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `''`\n\nThis is the full URL to which you can upload a file.\nYou can append some variables, like an API token.\n\n#### options.method\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `'POST'`\n\nThe HTTP method to use to upload the file.\nLook in the API documentation you want to use, this is usually POST or PUT.\n\n#### options.rejectUnauthorized\nType: `Boolean`\nDefault value: `true`\n\nVerify the server certificate and will fail if it is not valid.\nSet to false if you need to bypass the SSL verification.\n\n#### options.data\nType: `Object`\nDefault value: `{}`\n\nAny form data fields to be sent in addition to the file upload\n\n#### options.headers\nType: `Object`\nDefaultValue: `{}`\n\nHeaders to send along with your HTTP request. For example, a lot of API require the Authentication to be sent through the Headers.\n\n#### options.onComplete\nType: `Function`\nDefaultValue: `function(data) {}`\n\nCallback used to process server's response. For example, when server returns id of uploaded file you need to process afterwards.\n\n#### src\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `''`\n\nThe local path of the file you wish to upload, using the current working directory as a reference.\nYou can upload only 1 file at a time.\n\n#### dest\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `''`\n\nThe field name of the file to be uploaded, on the API side.\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n#### Default Options\nIn this example, the default POST method is used to upload the local picture `./images/status.jpg` to Basecamp. Their API can be accessed through the URL `https://basecamp.com` (using Basic Auth). When creating an attachment in Basecamp, the \"dest\" field name is not important, so you can set it to anything (`img` in this case).\n`method` is set to \"POST\", but could have been omitted as this is the default value.\nThe `onComplete` method is then used to display API's response.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  http_upload: {\n    basecamp: {\n      options: {\n        url: 'https://user:pwd@basecamp.com/99999999/api/v1/attachments.json',\n        method: 'POST',\n        onComplete: function(data) {\n            console.log('Response: ' + data);\n        }\n      },\n      src: 'images/status.jpg',\n      dest: 'img'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\nYou should fork this repo, and issue a Pull Request with your proposed changes.\n\n### Roadmap ideas\nFor now the upload is limited to 1 file per target. This could change if I find a scenario needing it.\n\n## Release History\n- 0.3.2 - 2016-10-18: Use [Request](https://github.com/request/request) instead of [Restler](https://github.com/danwrong/restler), which throws some [deprecation warning](https://github.com/DiscoverGrunt/grunt-http-upload/issues/12) on Node >= 6.0.0, and its project page seems dead. Request seems a pretty good alternative anyway.\n- 0.2.0 - 2016-03-01: Straight bump to 0.2.0 with updated Restler (3.4.0) dependency and Grunt 1.0 compatibility. Yo.\n- 0.1.8 - 2015-01-12: Happy New Year! Now gives more information on unknown error (like when there's no connectivity), rather than `null` (PR from [Marcus](https://github.com/marcusds)).\n- 0.1.7 - 2014-12-30: Add onComplete as an optional callback function used to process server's response (PR from [Remigiusz Jackowski](https://github.com/remiq)).\n- 0.1.6 - 2014-10-13: Add rejectUnauthorized option to bypass SSL certificate verification (PR from [GODDET](https://github.com/GODDET)).\n- 0.1.4/0.1.5 - 2014-05-25: Upload success on all 2XX codes (PR from [Shane Smith](http://github.com/shanesmith)) + Fix.\n- 0.1.3 - 2014-05-14: Added a headers option to send HTTP headers (PR from [Andrey Okonetchnikov](http://github.com/okonet)).\n- 0.1.2 - 2014-04-03: Updated Restler to latest (3.2.0) version.\n- 0.1.1 - 2014-04-03: Added a data option to pass other form data in addition to the uploaded file (PR from [Micah Condon](http://github.com/mcondon)).\n- 0.1.0 - 2013-10-30: Initial release. Supports only 1 multipart file upload.\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2013-10-31T01:44:29.083Z","modified":"2016-10-18T13:31:45.830Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"julienma","email":"hello@julienma.com"},"owners":[{"name":"julienma","email":"hello@julienma.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"grunt-http-upload","_nodeVersion":"6.7.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/grunt-http-upload-0.3.2.tgz_1476797502557_0.8146752240136266"},"_npmUser":{"name":"julienma","email":"hello@julienma.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.3","_rev":"1-d8953fd6423a880547627ae69b5d6b8a","_shasum":"149a44f07d008ba2548586c8e1bef7f492068621","author":{"name":"Julien M","url":"http://julienma.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/DiscoverGrunt/grunt-http-upload/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Julien Marchand","url":"http://julienma.com"},{"name":"Bastien Petit","url":"http://bastienpetit.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"149a44f07d008ba2548586c8e1bef7f492068621","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-http-upload/-/grunt-http-upload-0.3.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"julienma","email":"hello@julienma.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-10-18T13:31:45.830Z","created":"2013-10-31T01:44:29.083Z","0.1.0":"2013-10-31T01:44:32.849Z","0.1.1":"2014-04-03T21:46:40.519Z","0.1.2":"2014-04-03T22:10:55.320Z","0.1.3":"2014-05-14T07:47:46.229Z","0.1.4":"2014-05-25T22:00:45.484Z","0.1.5":"2014-05-25T22:12:42.412Z","0.1.6":"2014-10-13T19:21:37.917Z","0.1.7":"2014-12-30T14:27:13.453Z","0.1.8":"2015-01-12T18:22:36.242Z","0.2.0":"2016-03-01T03:32:36.060Z","0.3.2":"2016-10-18T13:31:45.830Z"},"users":{"julienma":true}}}
