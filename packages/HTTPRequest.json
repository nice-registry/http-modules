Major thanks to [node-XMLHttpRequest](https://github.com/driverdan/node-XMLHttpRequest) for giving us a XMLHttpRequest Object, that really helps make this both client/server.\n\n## Setup##\n\nTo set up HTTPRequest on your Node.js server use npm(case sensitive package name).\n\n\tnpm install HTTPRequest\n\nIf you want to use HTTPRequest on the client-side (browser), just include HTTPRequest.js into your page.\n\n\t<script type='text/javascript' src='HTTPRequest.js'></script>\n\n##Example##\nFirst, you have to do is require the HTTPRequest module (if you're using it client-side, this isn't necessary).\n\n\tvar HTTPRequest = require('HTTPRequest');\n\n```\nHTTPRequest.get('get_test.php', function(status, headers, content)\n{\n\tconsole.log(status, headers, content);\n});\n```\n\n##request##\n`request(url, parameters, callback)`\nA lower level function, but I hope you never really need to use it as `post`, `get` is a wrapper around it.\n\n##post##\n\n`post(url, data, callback, options)`\n\nA url, data(object, can be empty also `{}`), callback are required.\noptions is not required, but it can be a object.\n\n##get##\n`get(url, callback, options)`\nurl and callback are required. \n\noptions is not required, but it can be a object.\n\n##delete##\n`del(url, callback, options)`\n\nsame as get\n\n##put##\n`put(url, data, callback, options)`\n\nsame as post\n\n##encode##\n`encode(url)`\n\ntakes a url and escapes it, then returns it.\n\n##decode##\n`encode(url)`\n\ntakes a decodeed url and Unencode's it, then returns it.\n\n\n##options##\n\n*option names are NOT case sensitive.\n\n* `USERAGENT` - string - Write your own [user agent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent), default is `node.js`. Setting this ONLY works on the server.\n* `QUERY` - `string` or `object` - appends to the end of the `url`.\n* `DATA` - `'POST'` or `'PUT'` data `string` or `object`\n\n##parameters##\nEverything as options, but also:\n\n`METHOD` - string - `'GET'`, `'POST'`, `'PUT'` and `'DELETE'`, default is `'GET'`\n\n##callback##\n\n`status, headers, content`\n\n* `status` - is HTTP code (like 404 or 200)\n* `headers` - is a object with the respone headers\n* `content` - The metadata `","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2012-06-03T00:25:14.071Z"},{"number":"0.0.2","date":"2012-06-03T10:58:20.745Z"},{"number":"0.0.3","date":"2012-06-06T03:39:52.748Z"},{"number":"0.0.4","date":"2012-06-06T06:21:45.848Z"},{"number":"0.0.5","date":"2012-06-06T16:08:23.459Z"},{"number":"0.0.6","date":"2012-06-06T16:26:27.225Z"},{"number":"0.0.7","date":"2012-06-06T18:24:45.348Z"},{"number":"0.0.8","date":"2012-06-06T18:52:29.869Z"},{"number":"0.0.9","date":"2012-06-06T23:56:08.756Z"},{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2012-10-03T02:02:13.982Z"},{"number":"0.1.1","date":"2012-10-03T11:20:24.725Z"}],"created":"2012-06-03T00:25:13.167Z","modified":"2012-10-03T11:20:24.725Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"keverw","email":"keverw92@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"keverw","email":"keverw92@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"HTTPRequest","_npmUser":{"name":"keverw","email":"keverw92@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.59","_rev":"1-988df9b02ebfbde3667f0e5b6a7cc9d5","author":{"name":"Kevin Whitman","url":"https://github.com/keverw"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"7a8c189e520079e055950a75622433e5723f8b35","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/HTTPRequest/-/HTTPRequest-0.1.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"keverw","email":"keverw92@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2012-10-03T11:20:24.725Z","created":"2012-06-03T00:25:13.167Z","0.0.1":"2012-06-03T00:25:14.071Z","0.0.2":"2012-06-03T10:58:20.745Z","0.0.3":"2012-06-06T03:39:52.748Z","0.0.4":"2012-06-06T06:21:45.848Z","0.0.5":"2012-06-06T16:08:23.459Z","0.0.6":"2012-06-06T16:26:27.225Z","0.0.7":"2012-06-06T18:24:45.348Z","0.0.8":"2012-06-06T18:52:29.869Z","0.0.9":"2012-06-06T23:56:08.756Z","0.1.0":"2012-10-03T02:02:13.982Z","0.1.1":"2012-10-03T11:20:24.725Z"}}}
