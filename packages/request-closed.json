It has been tested with Express,\nbut may also work with other frameworks. If you test this with another framework and find it to work, let me know and\nI'll update the docs.\n\nThis library is useful for times when you want to statically check the state of the request before performing some\naction (e.g. updating a database). If you need an event driven model, the `req.on('close', function() { ... })`\nevent handler will suit your needs better.\n\n## Set up\nrequest-closed should be placed before any route definitions.\n\n```\nvar express = require('express');\nvar requestClosed = require('request-closed');\n\nvar app = express();\n...\napp.use(requestClosed());\n```\n\n## Usage\nOnce the middleware is in place, it will add a boolean `isClosed` property to the request object. This property will\nevaluate to `false` initially, and will flip to `true` if the request is closed before a response is sent.\n\n```\nif (req.isClosed) {\n\t// throw an exception, or take some alternate action\n}\n```\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2016-04-19T17:17:21.128Z","modified":"2017-02-23T09:30:25.333Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mhamann","email":"matthew.hamann@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mhamann","email":"matthew.hamann@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"request-closed","_nodeVersion":"4.2.6","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/request-closed-1.0.0.tgz_1461086238649_0.919546029297635"},"_npmUser":{"name":"mhamann","email":"matthew.hamann@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.12","_rev":"44-a650af34496b670b2c111bcf45c2981a","_shasum":"66329bce600616b2976b953c2abde7382c07daa6","author":{"name":"Matt Hamann","url":"matthew.hamann@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mhamann/request-closed/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"66329bce600616b2976b953c2abde7382c07daa6","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/request-closed/-/request-closed-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mhamann","email":"matthew.hamann@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-02-23T09:30:25.333Z","created":"2016-04-19T17:17:21.128Z","1.0.0":"2016-04-19T17:17:21.128Z"},"users":{"ivangaravito":true,"zhuxiandong":true}}}
