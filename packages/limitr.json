For instance, you might want to increase the rate-limit for the resources that are not subject to much traffic, and decrease it for the ones that are.\n\n```javascript\nvar config = {\n  limit: 10,\n  rate: 1,\n  clientId: 'ip', //default\n  ignore: ['127.0.0.1'], \n  message: 'API rate limit exceeded. See https://foo-url.com/api#rate-limits for details.'\n};\nlimitr(config);\n```\n\n### Options\n\nThe required options are `limit` and `rate`; all others are optional.\n\n* `limit`- the rate limit ceiling.\n* `rate`- the rate at which the limit window will be reset.\n* `clientId`- the value (preferably unique) in the `req` object by which to identify the client (default: `'ip'`)\n* `ignore`- a set of clients that will not be subject to rate-limiting (default: `[]`)\n* `message`- the message to be returned to the client when the limit is exceeded (default: `'API rate limit exceeded.'`)\n\n## HTTP Headers and Response Codes\n\nHTTP headers are returned in order to keep the client informed about his rate limit for a given API endpoint.\n\n* `X-RateLimit-Limit`- the rate limit ceiling for that given request.\n* `X-RateLimit-Remaining`- the number of requests left for rate window.\n* `X-RateLimit-Reset`- the remaining window before the rate limit resets in UTC epoch milliseconds.\n\nWhen a client exceeds the rate limit for a given API endpoint, limitr will interrupt the request and return an HTTP 429 [“Too Many Requests”](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4) response code. The body will contain the `message`.\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Carlos González\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
