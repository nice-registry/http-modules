It takes the received HTTP POST requests from Thingsee One devices and just forwards them to the client (and only the latest one) that has requested them on per-device basis.\n\n## Installation\n\n```npm install thingsee-simple-ws-proxy --save```\n\n## Usage\n\nConfigure your Thingsee One to send it's events to your proxy server. The default API path is SERVERNAME:PORT/api/events.\n\nAdd the proxy to your node app.\n\n```javascript\n\n// Launch HTTP-to-WS proxy\nvar TSWS = require('thingsee-ws-proxy');\n\nvar settings = {\n    wsPort:     8101,\n    httpPort:   8100,\n    apiPath:    '/api/events'\n    //httpHost:   '',\n}\n\nvar ws = TSWS.listen(settings);\n\n```\n\nSubscribe to device events from your web app.\n\n```javascript\n\n// Open a websocket connection the TS proxy server\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://' + window.location.hostname + ':8001' );\n\n// Subscribe to device events by providing the device UUID\nws.onopen = function() {\n  ws.send(deviceUuid);  // Register device (only one listener per device)\n};\n\n// Implement a receiver for device events\nws.onmessage = function(e) {\n\n// Do something with event data, eg.\n  var payload = JSON.parse(e.data);\n  updateGameLoop(payload);\n};\n\nws.onclose = function() {\n  //Proxy handles closed connections automatically.\n  console.log(\"ws closed\");\n};\n\n```\n\n## Release History\n\n* 0.0.1 Initial release\n* 0.0.2 Typo fixes\n","created":"2015-10-12T23:09:59.178Z","modified":"2015-10-12T23:14:00.516Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"pasiaj","email":"pasi.jokinen@thingsee.com"},"owners":[{"name":"pasiaj","email":"pasi.jokinen@thingsee.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"thingsee-simple-ws-proxy","_nodeVersion":"0.12.2","_npmUser":{"name":"pasiaj","email":"pasi.jokinen@thingsee.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.7.5","_rev":"1-2b0a097ebb231d060c6b97cc7f9f5d4d","_shasum":"461947ae5c3734ce7b44b420548f57211c114bca","author":{"name":"Pasi Jokinen","email":"pasi.jokinen@thingsee.com","url":"https://thingsee.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/thingsee/thingsee-simple-ws-proxy/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"461947ae5c3734ce7b44b420548f57211c114bca","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/thingsee-simple-ws-proxy/-/thingsee-simple-ws-proxy-0.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"pasiaj","email":"pasi.jokinen@thingsee.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-10-12T23:14:00.516Z","created":"2015-10-12T23:09:59.178Z","0.0.1":"2015-10-12T23:09:59.178Z","0.0.2":"2015-10-12T23:14:00.516Z"}}}
