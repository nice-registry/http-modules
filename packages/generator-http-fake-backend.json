He’s a person with feelings and opinions, but he’s very easy to work with. If you think he’s too opinionated, he can be easily convinced. Feel free to [learn more about him](http://yeoman.io/).\n\n## Related\n\n* [http-fake-backend](https://github.com/micromata/http-fake-backend) – Static version of the hapi server that this generator creates.\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Micromata](www.micromata.de)\n\nPlease be aware of the licenses of the components we use in this project.\nEverything else that has been developed by the contributions to this project is under [MIT License](LICENSE).\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2016-03-20T00:14:24.060Z","modified":"2017-06-04T19:53:12.413Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mischah","email":"mail@michael-kuehnel.de"},"owners":[{"email":"rene.viering@gmail.com","name":"revrng"},{"email":"mail@michael-kuehnel.de","name":"mischah"},{"email":"www.krnl.de@gmail.com","name":"krnlde"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"generator-http-fake-backend","_nodeVersion":"6.9.5","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/generator-http-fake-backend-2.0.1.tgz_1491091765950_0.03215493890456855"},"_npmUser":{"name":"mischah","email":"mail@michael-kuehnel.de"},"_npmVersion":"4.2.0","_rev":"6-7625af4228ce426db187055ab12ffa69","_shasum":"f1857538c97a9ace098e5a866126529204243dcc","author":{"name":"Michael Kühnel","email":"m.kuehnel@micromata.de","url":"http://micromata.de"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/micromata/generator-http-fake-backend/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"f1857538c97a9ace098e5a866126529204243dcc","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/generator-http-fake-backend/-/generator-http-fake-backend-2.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"rene.viering@gmail.com","name":"revrng"},{"email":"mail@michael-kuehnel.de","name":"mischah"},{"email":"www.krnl.de@gmail.com","name":"krnlde"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-04T19:53:12.413Z","created":"2016-03-20T00:14:24.060Z","0.0.0":"2016-03-20T00:14:24.060Z","1.0.0":"2016-03-20T00:31:45.226Z","1.0.1":"2016-03-20T22:17:04.713Z","1.0.2":"2016-03-21T23:24:17.091Z","1.0.4":"2016-06-02T13:16:18.232Z","1.0.5":"2016-06-19T19:54:22.968Z","1.0.6":"2016-08-27T21:28:29.846Z","1.0.7":"2016-09-17T11:24:35.626Z","1.1.0":"2016-09-28T20:54:30.851Z","1.1.1":"2016-10-06T23:43:11.179Z","1.2.0":"2016-10-16T19:30:37.595Z","1.2.1":"2016-11-27T12:35:19.988Z","2.0.0":"2016-12-20T20:49:05.235Z","2.0.1":"2017-04-02T00:09:27.827Z"},"users":{"mischah":true}}}
