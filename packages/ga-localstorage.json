Read these.\r\n\r\n * You cannot do cross-domain tracking of a user. You will not be able to track the same user on both http﻿://w﻿ww.e﻿xample.com and http﻿://e﻿xample.com. A single user visiting both of these will result in two unique users.\r\n * You cannot do cross-scheme tracking of a user. You will not be able to track the same user on both http**s**://w﻿ww.e﻿xample.com and http﻿://w﻿ww.e﻿xample.com. A single user visiting both of these will result in two unique users.\r\n * You might not be able to utilize some of the advanced Google Analytics features.\r\n\r\nYou should only use this script if all of the following are true:\r\n\r\n * the site you are tracking doesn't track users on other subdomains.\r\n * the site you are tracking is always served over https or always over http, never both/either.\r\n * you pretty much just track page views, users, and/or events (since that is all I've tested myself).\r\n \r\n \r\n**Another thing to note: this script changes the global `ga` function to `ct`. If you call `ga` in your scripts to track events, make sure you update all your `ga()` calls to `ct()` calls!**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDid you read the [Important Caveats](#user-content-important-caveats-read-these)? Make sure you do that before you read any more.\r\n\r\n### Copy+Paste\r\n\r\n 1. Copy the code in [ga-localstorage.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidmurdoch/ga-localstorage/ga-localstorage.js) into your project's template file.\r\n 2. Replace UA-XXXXXXXX-X with your TrackingID.\r\n\r\n### npm\r\n\r\n  0. Install node and npm (if you don't know what these are, or don't have these installed already, you should probably follow the [Copy+Paste](#user-content-copypaste) section above).\r\n  1. Install the ga-localstorage package (optionally saving it to your package.json):\r\n    - `npm install ga-localstorage --save`\r\n  3. Build your Google Analytics JavaScript snippet:\r\n    - `var analyticsSnippet = require(\"ga-localstorage\")(\"UA-8675309-1\");`\r\n  4. Do whatever you want with it.\r\n    - you should probably output it between a `<script>` and a `</script>` right before `</body>`.\r\n\r\n## History ##\r\n\r\nRead [Google Async Analytics using LocalStorage](https://davidmurdoch.com/2014/09/22/google-async-analytics-using-localstorage/) for the back story.\r\n\r\nRead [Use localStorage for Google Analytics tracking when available #1444](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues/1444) for more fun [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/).\r\n\r\n## Feedback ##\r\n\r\nGive it to me [here](https://github.com/davidmurdoch/ga-localstorage/issues) and at [@pxcoach](https://twitter.com/pxcoach).\r\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2014-10-15T21:42:21.983Z","modified":"2016-04-26T17:53:11.632Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"davidmurdoch","email":"david@davidmurdoch.com"},"owners":[{"name":"davidmurdoch","email":"david@davidmurdoch.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ga-localstorage","_nodeVersion":"4.4.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/ga-localstorage-1.0.2.tgz_1461693190752_0.37831153627485037"},"_npmUser":{"name":"davidmurdoch","email":"david@davidmurdoch.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.15.1","_rev":"1-a75251a4271aced0c486fdbb504f358e","_shasum":"2bfd3247c74176e794ef385a28483cdf9500f6f4","author":{"name":"David Murdoch","email":"david@davidmurdoch.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/davidmurdoch/ga-localstorage/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"David Murdoch","email":"david@davidmurdoch.com"},{"name":"Mathias Bynens","email":"mathias@qiwi.be","url":"http://mathiasbynens.be/"},{"name":"Elmer Bulthuis","url":"https://twitter.com/elmerbulthuis"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"2bfd3247c74176e794ef385a28483cdf9500f6f4","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ga-localstorage/-/ga-localstorage-1.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"davidmurdoch","email":"david@davidmurdoch.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-04-26T17:53:11.632Z","created":"2014-10-15T21:42:21.983Z","1.0.0":"2014-10-15T21:42:22.986Z","1.0.1":"2014-10-15T21:45:59.616Z","1.0.2":"2016-04-26T17:53:11.632Z"},"users":{"davidmurdoch":true}}}
