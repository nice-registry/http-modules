If you are unsure which mode to use, try this one first.\n\n### `model.url`\n\nUsage:\n\n``` js\nvar Model = Backbone.Model.extend({\n  url: 'http://username:password@path/to/basic/auth/protected/resource'\n});\n\nvar model = new Model();\nmodel.fetch();\n```\n\nThis mode is good for models where the username/password is unlikely to change, e.g. a fixed API key for your app. The plugin takes care of parsing the URL to create the necessary Basic Authentication header, and jQuery removes the credentials from the URL so your username and password isn't sent to the server directly on the URL.\n\nThanks goes to [Luis Abreu](https://github.com/lmjabreu) for his work implementing this.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nA resource protected with HTTP Basic Authentication requires the following HTTP header to be set on every request:\n\n```\nAuthorization: Basic <accesstoken>\n```\n\nThe access token is formed by taking the username and password, concatenating together with a `:` separator and encoding into Base64.\n\nThis plugin handles the Base64 encoding and automatically sets the `Authorization` header on every request which uses `Backbone.sync`.\n\n## Creating header for use elsewhere\n\nOn occasion, it can be useful to bypass `Backbone.sync` and use raw `$.ajax` (for example, when hitting server API resources which do not conform to RESTful principles). More information on this subject can be found in [this excellent blog post by Derick Bailey](http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2012/05/04/wrapping-ajax-in-a-thin-command-framework-for-backbone-apps/).\n\nIf you need/want to do this, there is a convenience function which will help you build the BasicAuth header: `Backbone.BasicAuth.getHeader()`, which can be used to create the header to be set directly on the AJAX request.\n\nExample:\n\n``` js\n// Pass the credentials to the plugin to build the header\n$.ajax({\n  method: 'GET',\n  dataType: \"json\",\n  url: 'http://path/to/basic/auth/protected/resource',\n  headers: Backbone.BasicAuth.getHeader({\n  \tusername: 'user',\n  \tpassword: 'pass'\n\t})\n});\n\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n - [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org)\n - [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org) or [Lodash](http://lodash.com)\n - JavaScript [`btoa()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.btoa) function (a [polyfill](https://github.com/davidchambers/Base64.js) is available if `btoa()` is not supported in your target browser)\n\n## Server-side\n\nThe idea of this plugin is to adhere to the standard [HTTP Basic Authentication](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt) scheme. There is bound to be a 'basic' way to read the username / password combination in your chosen server-side language.\n\n[See here for a PHP example.](http://php.net/manual/en/features.http-auth.php)\n\n## Change Log\n\n### v0.4.2 (30th June 2016)\n\n- Added support for CommonJS.\n\n### v0.4.1 (16th October 2015)\n\n- Integrated `package.json` for use with npm.\n\n### v0.4.0 (23rd July 2013)\n\n- Re-introduced concept of setting Basic Auth credentials from a function, in addition to URL-based method.\n\n### v0.3.0 (22nd July 2013)\n\n - Moved to use the standard method of HTTP Basic Authentication, by adding `username:password` to the URL string. The old method of setting the Basic Auth token (`Backbone.BasicAuth.set` / `Backbone.BasicAuth.remove`) has now been removed from the codebase. Thanks to [Luis Abreu](https://github.com/lmjabreu) for the PR.\n - Added AMD support (thanks again [Luis Abreu](https://github.com/lmjabreu)).\n\n### v0.2.0 (1st May 2013)\n\n - Added Bower support.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2013, Tom Spencer (@fiznool), Luis Abreu (@lmjabreu).\n\nbackbone.basicauth.js may be freely distributed under the MIT license.\n","versions":[{"number":"1.0.0","date":"2014-11-26T22:53:37.633Z"},{"number":"0.4.0","date":"2014-11-26T22:54:10.221Z"},{"number":"0.4.1","date":"2015-10-16T21:06:09.965Z"},{"number":"0.4.2","date":"2016-06-30T11:13:07.750Z"}],"created":"2014-11-26T22:53:37.633Z","modified":"2016-06-30T11:13:07.750Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"fiznool","email":"fiznool@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"fiznool","email":"fiznool@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"backbone.basicauth","_nodeVersion":"6.2.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/backbone.basicauth-0.4.2.tgz_1467285185312_0.6622694488614798"},"_npmUser":{"name":"fiznool","email":"fiznool@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.9.5","_rev":"1-f61623021a7e8501f5e5390f87234456","_shasum":"046bb3a4a9eba16c48d6d74a6bf8e5cd97975839","author":{"name":"Tom Spencer","email":"fiznool@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/fiznool/backbone.basicauth/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.4.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"046bb3a4a9eba16c48d6d74a6bf8e5cd97975839","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/backbone.basicauth/-/backbone.basicauth-0.4.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"fiznool","email":"fiznool@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-06-30T11:13:07.750Z","created":"2014-11-26T22:53:37.633Z","1.0.0":"2014-11-26T22:53:37.633Z","0.4.0":"2014-11-26T22:54:10.221Z","0.4.1":"2015-10-16T21:06:09.965Z","0.4.2":"2016-06-30T11:13:07.750Z"}}}
