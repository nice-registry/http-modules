Whenever a file changes, it is read from disk and sent to the page\nusing WebSockets. This server injects a client-side handler which responds to\nthis WebSocket event, and using diffHTML, diffs the contents seamlessly without\nneeding to reload. This includes all `<HTML>`, `<HEAD>`, and `<BODY>` tag\nchanges. Provides smart CSS reloading, that instantly updates.\n\nTakes a \"just works\" approach by automatically injecting the synchronization\ncode.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install via `yarn` or `npm`, below you will see commands to install\nglobally which is what is most commonly used for command line tools.\n\nWith npm:\n\n``` sh\nnpm install -g diffhtml-static-sync\n```\n\nWith yarn:\n\n```\nyarn global add diffhtml-static-sync\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIf all goes well, you should now have a `diffhtml-static-sync` command in your\n`PATH` which means you can execute it in the command line. Open an existing\nfolder with HTML files or make a new one and run this command in it. You\nshouldn't see any output just yet, but the command should appear to hang.\n\nOnce you open your browser to: http://localhost:8000/ you should see the\n`index.html` file or a directory listing to chose from.\n\nBasic usage:\n\n``` sh\nλ diffhtml-static-sync .\nOpen http://localhost:8000\n\nWaiting for changes ⣻ Socket connection established\n```\n\nPass `--quiet` to prevent verbose logging in the browser console and terminal.\n\n## Markdown\n\nMarkdown is supported out-of-the-box, browse them as you would normal HTML\nfiles. Name your markdown files with `index.markdown` or `index.md` to be\npicked up automatically in folders.\n\n## LiveReload\n\nBy default any other file types are treated as a full page reload.\n\n## Static Handler\n\nYou can define your own handlers to respond to file changes. These are set up\nas a global `Set`. Like so:\n\n``` js\nwindow.staticSyncHandlers = new Set();\n```\n\nYou can add your own function hooks into the Set, but calling `add`:\n\n``` js\nstaticSyncHandlers.add(({ file, markup /*, quiet */ }) => {\n  if (file === 'some/file') {\n    // Do something with the contents\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThere is an optional argument quiet, shown above, that you can use to silence\nlogging output to prevent clutter in the console. This is toggled from the\n`--quiet` CLI flag.\n","created":"2017-05-30T18:29:37.109Z","modified":"2017-06-11T23:33:58.417Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tbranyen","email":"tim@tabdeveloper.com"},"owners":[{"name":"tbranyen","email":"tim@tabdeveloper.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"diffhtml-static-sync","_nodeVersion":"6.8.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/diffhtml-static-sync-1.0.0-beta.6.tgz_1497224038328_0.8378328459803015"},"_npmUser":{"name":"tbranyen","email":"tim@tabdeveloper.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.6.1","_rev":"7-2331b80b4993c11cc0fccd2378d74e47","_shasum":"d8f48796065a358c6bad6c00ec62053cd6ee6f4a","author":{"name":"Tim Branyen","url":"@tbranyen"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0-beta.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"d8f48796065a358c6bad6c00ec62053cd6ee6f4a","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/diffhtml-static-sync/-/diffhtml-static-sync-1.0.0-beta.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tbranyen","email":"tim@tabdeveloper.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-11T23:33:58.417Z","created":"2017-05-30T18:29:37.109Z","1.0.0-beta":"2017-05-30T18:29:37.109Z","1.0.0-beta.1":"2017-05-30T18:48:24.521Z","1.0.0-beta.2":"2017-06-07T17:48:00.473Z","1.0.0-beta.3":"2017-06-07T19:25:12.462Z","1.0.0-beta.4":"2017-06-08T03:50:46.991Z","1.0.0-beta.5":"2017-06-11T22:11:41.679Z","1.0.0-beta.6":"2017-06-11T23:33:58.417Z"}}}
