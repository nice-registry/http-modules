Inspired by python's `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`\n\n## Installation\n\nRun `npm install -g httpea`\n\n## Usage\n\n1. cd into the folder\n2. run `httpea`\n3. Enjoy\n\nA simple http server will start running and serving the static files of your folder from `http://localhost`. If the port 80 is not available a random port will be selected (you'll see which one on the terminal/cmd output). If the path is a directory, the server will look for an `index.html` file.\n","created":"2015-05-10T20:38:40.009Z","modified":"2017-02-01T18:24:57.530Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"imagentleman","email":"imagentlemail@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"imagentleman","email":"imagentlemail@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"httpea","_nodeVersion":"5.12.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/httpea-3.0.4.tgz_1485973496880_0.5122607459779829"},"_npmUser":{"name":"imagentleman","email":"imagentlemail@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"2-950aa6b3f30d8cd590569a50caf45d5e","_shasum":"ddd10d55321649a936b525c028b89661715e0090","author":{"name":"imagentleman"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/imagentleman/httpea/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"3.0.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"ddd10d55321649a936b525c028b89661715e0090","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/httpea/-/httpea-3.0.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"imagentleman","email":"imagentlemail@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-02-01T18:24:57.530Z","created":"2015-05-10T20:38:40.009Z","1.0.0":"2015-05-10T20:38:40.009Z","2.0.0":"2015-05-10T20:40:54.134Z","3.0.0":"2015-05-10T20:58:23.541Z","3.0.1":"2015-05-10T21:20:19.162Z","3.0.2":"2015-05-10T21:28:34.637Z","3.0.3":"2016-10-06T05:34:24.892Z","3.0.4":"2017-02-01T18:24:57.530Z"}}}
