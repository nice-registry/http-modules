For instance the code 404 is returned by the endpoint `/404` (i.e. by accessing `localhost:3000/404` with the default configuration).\n","created":"2017-01-23T19:50:21.234Z","modified":"2017-01-24T07:04:55.696Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ptitficus","email":"benjamin.cavy@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"ptitficus","email":"benjamin.cavy@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-status-mock","_nodeVersion":"7.4.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http-status-mock-1.0.1.tgz_1485241495041_0.7997518822085112"},"_npmUser":{"name":"ptitficus","email":"benjamin.cavy@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.0.5","_rev":"2-c8adfb852a37370e2355d6175d85e3a5","_shasum":"7973d873761ca70aadcd5ca56a8d7a92506e3dcf","author":{"name":"Benjamin Cavy"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ptitFicus/http-status-mock/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"7973d873761ca70aadcd5ca56a8d7a92506e3dcf","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/http-status-mock/-/http-status-mock-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ptitficus","email":"benjamin.cavy@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-24T07:04:55.696Z","created":"2017-01-23T19:50:21.234Z","1.0.0":"2017-01-23T19:50:21.234Z","1.0.1":"2017-01-24T07:04:55.696Z"}}}
