It can be used as an init script and supports the following commands\n\n\tstart, restart, stop, status\n\nIf you want to run pushinator without config arguement, the configuration must be placed in /etc/pushinator.conf.\n\nThe following command starts pushinator as a daemon with config file located in /etc/pushinator/node1.conf\n\n\tpushinator start -c /etc/pushinator/node1.conf\n\nTo stop it, use the following command\n\n\tpushinator stop -c /etc/pushinator/node1.conf\n\n### Logging\n\nBy default, pushinator is logging to stdout if it's not started as a daemon.\nIn daemon mode it's logging to syslog, if enabled. If syslog is not enabled,\nand pushinator is running as daemon, it's logging to /dev/null.\n\n### socket.io transports\n\nYou can specify the transports used by socket.io in the pushinator configuration. Order matters.\n\n### Admin connection\n\nThrough the admin connection, you can register new clients and send messages to them.\n\nRegistering a new user expects an userId and a hash.\n\tcurl http://127.0.0.1:9600/user/register -d '{\"userId\":5,\"hash\":\"xxx1234\"}'\n\nSending a message to an user expects an userId and a message.\n\tcurl http://127.0.0.1:9600/user/send -d '{\"userId\":5,\"message\":\"example message\"}'\n\n### Client connection\n\nBefore a socket.io client is able to receive messages from pushinator, it has to authenticate itself\nthrough the hash (which was set through the admin connection) and it's userId.\n\n```javascript\n\tvar userId = 5;\n\tvar hash = 'xx1234';\n\n\tvar socket = io.connect('http://127.0.0.1:9601');\n\tsocket.on('connect', function () {\n\t\t// authenticate\n\t\tsocket.emit('auth', userId, hash);\n\t});\n\n\tsocket.on('message', function (message) {\n\t\t// handle received message\n\t\talert(message);\n\t});\n```\n\nFor more thorough examples, look at the `examples/` directory.\n","created":"2011-08-09T16:50:39.954Z","modified":"2014-10-03T07:16:30.889Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"brstgt","email":"brstgt@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"saz","email":"me@saz.sh"},{"name":"brstgt","email":"brstgt@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"pushinator","_nodeVersion":"0.10.28","_npmUser":{"name":"brstgt","email":"brstgt@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.1.3","_rev":"1-3d50f694a5ea78422c307b1481dd96b8","_shasum":"4dd04e5200243f557cebee912b30e0458c9aea65","author":{"name":"Gabriel Duman","email":"gabriel.duman@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/KWICKCommunity/pushinator/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Steffen Zieger","email":"me@saz.sh","url":"http://saz.sh"},{"name":"Benjamin Roth","email":"brstgt@gmail.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.6.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"4dd04e5200243f557cebee912b30e0458c9aea65","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/pushinator/-/pushinator-1.6.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"saz","email":"me@saz.sh"},{"name":"brstgt","email":"brstgt@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-10-03T07:16:30.889Z","created":"2011-08-09T16:50:39.954Z","0.9.7":"2011-08-09T16:50:45.788Z","0.9.8":"2011-08-09T17:52:25.144Z","0.9.9":"2011-08-10T08:43:46.483Z","0.9.10":"2011-08-10T09:10:20.455Z","0.9.11":"2011-08-15T16:13:08.067Z","1.0.0":"2011-11-08T15:05:20.998Z","1.5.0":"2012-03-27T09:38:34.419Z","1.5.1":"2012-03-27T13:08:58.385Z","1.5.2":"2012-04-24T13:41:56.471Z","1.5.3":"2012-04-24T13:43:51.578Z","1.5.4":"2012-06-05T16:25:27.636Z","1.6.0":"2012-08-21T13:03:40.623Z","1.6.1":"2012-11-15T15:53:34.315Z","1.6.2":"2013-07-12T16:08:52.896Z","1.6.3":"2014-10-03T07:16:30.889Z"}}}
