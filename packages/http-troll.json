Once started, it provides you a HTTP endpoint pointing \nto your origin of choice.\n\nYou can configure random response times and a HTTP 503 response ratio.\n\n## Installation\n\n```javascript\nnpm install http-troll -g // <- global required\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nStart reverse proxy to `example.com`, listening on port 7000 with enabled access log.\n\n```bash\ntroll http://example.com -p 7000 --access-log\n```\n\n### Options\n```\nUsage: troll http://example.com [OPTIONS]\n\n  -p, --port=ARG    port for proxy to listen on\n  -l, --access-log  print access log\n  -r, --replay      replays previously made calls\n  -h, --help        display this help\n```\n\n### Configure via console\n\nOnce the server is started, you can just start typing those commands. They will be applied immediately. \n\n#### Set error rate to 50%\n\n```\nJust type in your terminal: 50%\n```\n\n#### Set response time delay to randomly 50-150ms\n\n```\nJust type in your terminal: 50,150\n```\n\n#### Stop the troll\n\n```\nJust type... ye you guess it: stop\n```\n\n### Configure via HTTP\n\nOnce started, it can be configured via console or http api. These changes will be applied immediately.\n\n#### set response time to 20 to 500ms\n\n```bash\ncurl -H 'response-times: 20,500' http://localhost:7000/configure\n```\n\n#### set HTTP 503 ratio to 40%\n\n```bash\ncurl -H 'error-503: 0.4' http://localhost:7000/configure\n```\n","created":"2015-08-11T21:37:07.077Z","modified":"2015-11-28T22:39:00.483Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mrcrgl","email":"mail@mrcrgl.de"},"owners":[{"name":"mrcrgl","email":"mail@mrcrgl.de"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-troll","_nodeVersion":"0.12.7","_npmUser":{"name":"mrcrgl","email":"mail@mrcrgl.de"},"_npmVersion":"2.11.3","_rev":"1-f22326bbdfc0b8648c28cc71a1d34b8a","_shasum":"384e754fe269c16b9d26e298a7280c4565d99fc4","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mrcrgl/http-troll/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"384e754fe269c16b9d26e298a7280c4565d99fc4","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-troll/-/http-troll-1.1.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mrcrgl","email":"mail@mrcrgl.de"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-11-28T22:39:00.483Z","created":"2015-08-11T21:37:07.077Z","1.0.0-alpha1":"2015-08-11T21:37:07.077Z","1.0.0":"2015-08-11T21:45:19.755Z","1.1.0":"2015-09-02T12:52:53.101Z","1.1.1":"2015-11-28T22:39:00.483Z"}}}
