It's not\na replacement for things like request, etc.. It's intended to make things like\nHTTP methods a bit easier to use by removing some of the boilerplate logic you\nusually have to write to make things work.\n\nFor example, enumerating methods allows you to use a switch statement like this:\n\t\n\tvar methods = require('nethelpers/methods');\n\tvar myMethod = 'post';\n\n\tswitch methods.fromStr(myMethod) {\n\t\tcase methods.options:\n\t\t\t// do something here\n\t\t...\n\t\tcase methods.post:\n\t\t\t// do something here\n\t}\n","created":"2015-08-29T23:59:05.750Z","modified":"2015-08-30T00:43:00.937Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"nickswift","email":"nickswift498@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"nickswift","email":"nickswift498@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"nethelpers","_nodeVersion":"0.12.4","_npmUser":{"name":"nickswift","email":"nickswift498@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.10.1","_rev":"1-53edd8ec32ab7cefd9f49e1db3139e40","_shasum":"2452c355eca23b7e74ddbc0a73725918b2636ac6","author":{"name":"Nick Wood"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nickswift/nethelpers/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"2452c355eca23b7e74ddbc0a73725918b2636ac6","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/nethelpers/-/nethelpers-0.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"nickswift","email":"nickswift498@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-08-30T00:43:00.937Z","created":"2015-08-29T23:59:05.750Z","0.0.1":"2015-08-29T23:59:05.750Z","0.0.2":"2015-08-30T00:40:18.313Z","0.0.3":"2015-08-30T00:43:00.937Z"}}}
