Then:\n\n    npm install -g httpserver\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nrun `httpserver` on the command line to fire up a server on `0.0.0.0` port `8080`.\n\n    $ httpserver\n    {\n      \"lo0\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n      \"en1\": \"10.0.1.204\"\n    }\n    server started: http://0.0.0.0:8080\n\n\nSee the page at [http://localhost:8080][1].\n\n`htppserver` will serve out of your current working directory.\n\nYou can pass in arguments to change the port and host, as well as environmental variables\n\n    $ httpserver 80 localhost\n\nor\n\n    $ HTTPSERVER_PORT=80 HTTPSERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1 httpserver\n\nexample\n\n    $ httpserver\n    {\n      \"lo0\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n      \"en1\": \"10.0.1.204\"\n    }\n    server started: http://0.0.0.0:8080\n    127.0.0.1 - - [30/Oct/2013:18:24:38 -0400] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 - \"-\" \"curl/7.30.0\"\n    127.0.0.1 - - [30/Oct/2013:18:24:41 -0400] \"GET /test/ HTTP/1.1\" 404 - \"-\" \"curl/7.30.0\"\n\nEnvironmental Variables\n-----------------------\n\n- `HTTPSERVER_HOST` host to serve from, defaults to `0.0.0.0`\n- `HTTPSERVER_PORT` port to serve from, defaults to `8080`\n- `HTTPSERVER_NO_INDEX` disable reading of index.html/index.htm if found\n- `HTTPSERVER_NO_DIR_LISTING` return 403 for directory listings\n\nAdvanced Usage\n--------------\n\n    usage: httpserver [options] [port] [host]\n\n    command line HTTP server tool for serving up local files, similar to python -mSimpleHTTPServer\n\n    options\n      -d, --disable-index       disable reading of index.html/index.htm if found, env HTTPSERVER_NO_INDEX\n      -h, --help                print this message and exit\n      -H, --host <host>         the host address on which to listen, env HTTPSERVER_HOST defaults to '0.0.0.0'\n      -n, --no-indexes          return 403 for directory requests instead of a directory listing, env HTTPSERVER_NO_DIR_LISTING\n      -p, --port <port>         the port on which to listen, env HTTPSERVER_PORT, defaults to 8080\n      -u, --updates             check for available updates on npm\n      -v, --version             print the version number and exit\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nThere are a lot of packages in npm that do the same thing.  I wanted something that\nclosely mimicked Python's `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` with the following conditions.\n\n- Easy - You shouldn't have to provide arguments to get something easy up and running.  The IP addresses\non the machine are also printed for you\n- Configurable - Command line options and environmental variables can modify behavior at runtime\n- Safe - All other packages I found online were susceptible to directory traversal. This isn't\n- Simple - All code is in one file\n- Parsable - GET requests to directories are returned as directory listings, add `?json` for JSON\n- Proper HTTP - Proper Mime types (using the Mime module) and Caching headers are returned\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMIT\n\n[0]: http://nodejs.org\n[1]: http://localhost:8080\n","starsCount":6,"created":"2013-04-11T05:43:20.455Z","modified":"2017-03-12T18:39:14.239Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"bahamas10","email":"dave@daveeddy.com"},"owners":[{"name":"bahamas10","email":"dave@daveeddy.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"httpserver","_nodeVersion":"7.5.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/httpserver-0.3.0.tgz_1489343952354_0.5125566956121475"},"_npmUser":{"name":"bahamas10","email":"dave@daveeddy.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.1.2","_rev":"3-b038e38a17c8b2922789061117b26cb7","_shasum":"e9aeaeb0d2d40b2ef812086bd0cf855053e70950","author":{"name":"Dave Eddy","email":"dave@daveeddy.com","url":"http://www.daveeddy.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bahamas10/node-httpserver/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"e9aeaeb0d2d40b2ef812086bd0cf855053e70950","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/httpserver/-/httpserver-0.3.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"bahamas10","email":"dave@daveeddy.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-12T18:39:14.239Z","created":"2013-04-11T05:43:20.455Z","0.0.0":"2013-04-11T05:43:23.195Z","0.0.1":"2013-04-11T08:19:51.903Z","0.0.2":"2013-04-12T21:39:37.402Z","0.0.3":"2013-04-14T21:47:29.646Z","0.0.4":"2013-04-16T01:33:00.624Z","0.0.5":"2013-04-23T08:24:49.115Z","0.0.6":"2013-04-29T22:53:18.507Z","0.0.7":"2013-05-18T18:11:02.819Z","0.0.8":"2013-09-10T03:05:56.881Z","0.0.9":"2013-10-30T07:37:09.509Z","0.0.10":"2013-11-04T17:44:53.249Z","0.0.11":"2013-11-04T20:00:14.524Z","0.0.12":"2013-11-07T20:40:53.977Z","0.0.13":"2013-11-09T19:13:45.539Z","0.0.14":"2013-11-12T06:09:13.072Z","0.1.0":"2014-01-16T23:15:39.655Z","0.2.0":"2015-02-20T18:26:30.410Z","0.3.0":"2017-03-12T18:39:14.239Z"},"users":{"vbv":true,"cycomachead":true,"abdul":true,"andrewtimney":true,"phritolay":true,"antanst":true}}}
