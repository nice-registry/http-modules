This is enforced by checking:\n\n* the timestamp of the request\n* the validity of the certificate\n* the signature of the the request signed with the aforementioned certificate\n\nThis module provides a function to handle this validation.\n\n\n### usage\n\n```javascript\nconst verifier = require('alexa-verifier')\n\n\nverifier(cert_url, signature, requestRawBody, callback)\n```\n\n* `cert_url`  full url of the certificate to verify (from HTTP request header named `signaturecertchainurl`)\n* `signature` signature of the request (from HTTP request header named `signature`)\n* `requestRawBody`  full body string from POST request\n* `callback`  completion function. has 1 argument which indicates error. falsey when verification passes\n","created":"2016-01-27T08:14:15.673Z","modified":"2017-04-11T02:12:54.477Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mreinstein","email":"reinstein.mike@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mkruse","email":"github@mattkruse.com"},{"name":"mreinstein","email":"reinstein.mike@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"alexa-verifier","_nodeVersion":"7.8.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/alexa-verifier-0.3.6.tgz_1491876772448_0.40767833101563156"},"_npmUser":{"name":"mreinstein","email":"reinstein.mike@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.2.0","_rev":"16-ac1a384339c96ffec2d5137d76fa461a","_shasum":"f49509794f5c6429126ef729a6e51b63d1f3e37f","author":{"name":"Mike Reinstein"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mreinstein/alexa-verifier/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"f49509794f5c6429126ef729a6e51b63d1f3e37f","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/alexa-verifier/-/alexa-verifier-0.3.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mkruse","email":"github@mattkruse.com"},{"name":"mreinstein","email":"reinstein.mike@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-11T02:12:54.477Z","created":"2016-01-27T08:14:15.673Z","0.0.1":"2016-01-27T08:14:15.673Z","0.0.2":"2016-01-27T08:19:38.413Z","0.0.3":"2016-01-27T08:21:45.677Z","0.0.4":"2016-06-01T00:28:07.921Z","0.0.5":"2016-07-05T18:15:20.824Z","0.1.0":"2017-01-05T22:20:35.434Z","0.1.1":"2017-01-05T22:29:42.328Z","0.1.2":"2017-01-05T22:38:06.216Z","0.1.3":"2017-01-06T00:17:30.503Z","0.2.0":"2017-01-16T18:41:02.109Z","0.3.0":"2017-01-30T17:08:28.255Z","0.3.1":"2017-03-11T03:22:57.616Z","0.3.2":"2017-03-26T00:12:46.773Z","0.3.3":"2017-03-26T00:36:06.522Z","0.3.4":"2017-04-03T18:26:59.663Z","0.3.5":"2017-04-03T18:31:47.086Z","0.3.6":"2017-04-11T02:12:54.477Z"}}}
