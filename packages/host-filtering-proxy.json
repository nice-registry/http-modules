This means HTTPS requests are filterable too.\r\n\r\nThe code hasn't been extensively tested yet. Contributions are welcome.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n$ npm install host-filtering-proxy\r\n```\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nvar hfp = require('host-filtering-proxy');\r\n\r\nvar test = [\r\n  'ad.doubleclick.net',\r\n  'googleads.g.doubleclick.net',\r\n  'ib.adnxs.com',\r\n  'cdn.adnxs.com',\r\n  'ad.turn.com',\r\n  'cdn.turn.com'\r\n];\r\n\r\nvar proxy = hfp.createProxy(function(host, reject) {\r\n  if(test.indexOf(host) !== -1) {\r\n    reject(true);\r\n  } else {\r\n    reject(false);\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n\r\nproxy.listen(8888, '127.0.0.1');\r\n```","created":"2014-05-28T09:17:46.991Z","modified":"2014-05-28T09:17:48.320Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"thibauts","email":"thibaut.seguy@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"thibauts","email":"thibaut.seguy@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"host-filtering-proxy","_npmUser":{"name":"thibauts","email":"thibaut.seguy@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.2","_rev":"1-124ba88d3d72b5c82afefc0674d5756b","author":{"name":"thibauts"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/thibauts/node-host-filtering-proxy/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"33cef4b7d305a2af70d9ffae0fe43972d33da600","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/host-filtering-proxy/-/host-filtering-proxy-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"thibauts","email":"thibaut.seguy@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-05-28T09:17:48.320Z","created":"2014-05-28T09:17:46.991Z","0.1.0":"2014-05-28T09:17:48.320Z"}}}
