It is very similar to\n[zappa](https://github.com/mauricemach/zappa)\nbut tries to be more lightweight.\n\n## Installation\n\n```plaintext\nnpm install shallot\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nProbably the shortest example possible\n\n```coffeescript\nrequire('shallot') -> @get -> 'Hello World!'\n```\n\n### No seriously\nShallot does not depend on express. It rather is up to you which kind\nof middlewares you want to use and what kind of rendering engine you require.\nIt uses\n[copperhead](https://github.com/niclashoyer/copperhead)\nas router.\n\n```coffeescript\nconnect = require 'connect'\n\nrequire('shallot') ->\n\n\t@use connect.static 'public'\n\n\t@get ->\n\t\t'Hello World!'\n\n\t@get '/:name', ->\n\t\t\"Hello #{@name}!\"\n```\n\n## More\nMore features may be added in the future. The main goal is to achieve the most\npowerful HTTP server functionality with minimal lines of code.\n\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2011-09-25T10:20:27.971Z"},{"number":"0.2.0","date":"2012-04-09T09:59:36.772Z"},{"number":"0.2.1-1","date":"2012-08-17T19:35:15.867Z"}],"created":"2011-09-25T10:20:26.364Z","modified":"2012-08-17T19:35:15.867Z","owners":[{"name":"niclashoyer","email":"niclas@verbugt.de"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"shallot","_rev":"1-1a26e9c3cf49936065705f314c918938","author":{"name":"Niclas Hoyer","email":"https://github.com/niclashoyer"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.1-1"},"dist":{"shasum":"0bc26c732e5fc04d40ee436e535d7aa247f3c0d3","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/shallot/-/shallot-0.2.1-1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"niclashoyer","email":"niclas@verbugt.de"}],"time":{"modified":"2012-08-17T19:35:15.867Z","created":"2011-09-25T10:20:26.364Z","0.1.0":"2011-09-25T10:20:27.971Z","0.2.0":"2012-04-09T09:59:36.772Z","0.2.1-1":"2012-08-17T19:35:15.867Z"}}}
