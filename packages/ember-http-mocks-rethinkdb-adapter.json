This is useful when you want to\ndevelop using live data that can be queried, e.g. with parameters\nlike `sortBy`, `limit`, `order`, `withFields`, `offset`.\n\nBelow is an example request URI using a query supported by the \n[rethinkdb_adapter]\n\n* http://localhost:4200/api/posts?limit=10&order=desc&offset=0&sortBy=date&withFields=title\n\nUsing this addon requires a local installation of RethinkDB and adapter.\n\nFor more information on using ember-cli, visit [ember-cli.com].\n\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install --save-dev rethinkdb_adapter\n    ember install:addon ember-http-mocks-rethinkdb-adapter\n\n\n## Generator: http-mocks-db\n\nThis addon uses Ember CLI generators to create a mock that is\nbacked up by a document store db, i.e. RethinkDB\n\n    ember generate http-mocks-db `your-resource-name-pluralized`\n\nFor example use `ember generate http-mocks-db posts` for a collection of\npost models. And with Ember data return `return this.store.find('post',\n{ sortBy: 'date', order: 'desc', limit: 100 })` from your route's model\nhook. After creating some records with the db administration tools, then\nuse your new endpoint backed by your db at http://localhost:4200/api/posts\n\nAfter generating a db backed http-mock it may help to restart your app\nwith `ember server`.\n\nFor more info on generators use `ember help generate`\n\n\n## RethinkDB\n\nHere is a [Ten-minute guide] on [RethinkDB]\n\n* [Install options]\n\nFor developers on a mac, install with [Homebrew], here is a link to a \n[shell script].\n\n    brew update && brew install rethinkdb\n\n\n### Starting your db\n\nSee the [30-second quickstart] for how to start and use the db.\n\nTo start the db (and create a db, if one doesn't exist), in the root of your\nproject use the command `rethinkdb`\n\nOnce you've started your db try out the [administration-tools] at\nhttp://localhost:8080\n\n\n### Back up your data\n\nSee the [Back up your data] guide for steps to import and export data.\n\nPerhaps create a data directory in your project to keep db dumps.\n\n\n[rethinkdb_adapter]: https://github.com/pixelhandler/rethinkdb_adapter\n[Ember CLI mocks-and-fixtures]: http://www.ember-cli.com/#mocks-and-fixtures\n[RethinkDB]: http://www.rethinkdb.com\n[Install options]: http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/\n[30-second quickstart]: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/quickstart/\n[administration-tools]: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/administration-tools/\n[Back up your data]: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/backup/\n[Homebrew]: http://brew.sh\n[shell script]: https://github.com/pixelhandler/ember-slide-deck/blob/master/bin/install_rethinkdb.sh\n[Ten-minute guide]: http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guide/javascript/\n[ember-cli.com]: http://www.ember-cli.com/\n","created":"2015-01-19T09:06:51.757Z","modified":"2015-01-21T07:05:41.686Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"pixelhandler","email":"pixelhandler@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"pixelhandler","email":"pixelhandler@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ember-http-mocks-rethinkdb-adapter","_npmUser":{"name":"pixelhandler","email":"pixelhandler@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.9","_rev":"1-e782891d5b6bfbb34e2b75737851e55d","_shasum":"e8bb230e1a13335b6c71c9e1754a0b061e7e75cc","author":{"name":"Bill Heaton","email":"pixelhandler@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/pixelhandler/ember-http-mocks-rethinkdb-adapter/issues"},"directories":{"doc":"doc","test":"tests"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"e8bb230e1a13335b6c71c9e1754a0b061e7e75cc","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ember-http-mocks-rethinkdb-adapter/-/ember-http-mocks-rethinkdb-adapter-0.1.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"pixelhandler","email":"pixelhandler@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-01-21T07:05:41.686Z","created":"2015-01-19T09:06:51.757Z","0.0.1":"2015-01-19T09:06:51.757Z","0.0.2":"2015-01-19T09:50:50.165Z","0.1.0":"2015-01-19T10:10:20.765Z","0.1.1":"2015-01-19T10:15:49.066Z","0.1.2":"2015-01-19T10:22:48.607Z","0.1.3":"2015-01-21T07:05:41.686Z"}}}
