It exposes a local directory through HTTP, simplifying development of front-end apps that require functionality blocked by cross-origin protections, e.g. [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/AJAX), [Canvas Image Processing](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_getimagedata.asp), [Web Audio Analysis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), [WebGL textures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebGL/Cross-Domain_Textures). \n\n`nano-server` provides some features that I didn't find in similar server packages:\n\n * Sends **gzipped** versions of files, if they are available.\n * Attempts to set the **Content-Type** header with the appropriate MIME type for browser-relevant file types.\n * **0** dependencies. Can be dropped into any project.\n\nUsage\n------\n\nThe simplest way to install `nano-server` is as a global install through **npm**:\n\n```bash\n  $ npm install -g nano-server\n```\n\nThen `nano-server` can be invoked as a command line executable:\n\n```bash\n  $ nano-server\n```\n\nBy default, `nano-server` will run on port **5000** and use the current working directory as its document root. Optionally, a port number can be passed as first argument on the command line:\n\n```bash\n  $ nano-server 3000\n```\n\nThe document root can be given as second argument, if desired.\n\n```bash\n  $ nano-server 5000 my_app/public_html\n```\n\nSince `nano-server` has no dependancies, it can be dropped directly into any project and invoked using `node` explicitly. This can be useful if you don't have the necessary permissions to do a global install on the machine you're using: \n\n```bash\n  $ cp nano-server ~/path/to/project/\n  $ cd ~/path/to/project/\n  $ node nano-server\n```\n\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2014-07-22T16:14:24.517Z","modified":"2017-05-04T10:48:16.594Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tsherif","email":"tsherif@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"tsherif","email":"tsherif@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"nano-server","_nodeVersion":"6.10.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/nano-server-0.5.4.tgz_1493894895948_0.5860003693960607"},"_npmUser":{"name":"tsherif","email":"tsherif@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"2-b69f7d5ae10620ba4b4799fe876a9d76","_shasum":"7a3f91de5850819f06f07c60daea9b402bd9eb3d","author":{"name":"Tarek Sherif","email":"tsherif@gmail.com","url":"http://tareksherif.ca/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tsherif/nano-server/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"7a3f91de5850819f06f07c60daea9b402bd9eb3d","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/nano-server/-/nano-server-0.5.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tsherif","email":"tsherif@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-04T10:48:16.594Z","created":"2014-07-22T16:14:24.517Z","0.2.1":"2014-07-22T16:20:38.771Z","0.2.2":"2014-07-22T16:22:35.410Z","0.2.3":"2014-07-22T16:24:18.458Z","0.2.4":"2014-07-22T16:30:43.465Z","0.2.5":"2014-07-22T16:31:35.263Z","0.2.6":"2014-07-22T16:34:35.334Z","0.2.7":"2014-07-22T21:18:20.763Z","0.2.8":"2014-07-22T21:20:57.013Z","0.2.9":"2014-07-22T21:24:19.273Z","0.3.0":"2014-07-23T13:18:28.257Z","0.3.1":"2014-08-11T16:48:17.163Z","0.3.2":"2014-08-11T17:54:58.987Z","0.4.0":"2014-08-12T18:01:13.282Z","0.4.1":"2014-08-20T19:21:23.042Z","0.4.2":"2014-08-31T12:00:40.900Z","0.5.0":"2014-11-02T11:50:40.266Z","0.5.2":"2014-11-02T13:23:56.461Z","0.5.3":"2014-11-02T13:26:15.589Z","0.5.4":"2017-05-04T10:48:16.594Z"},"users":{"vbv":true}}}
