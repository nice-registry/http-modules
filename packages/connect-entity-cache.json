It supports conditional GET requests (based on `If-Last-Modified` and/or `If-None-Match` request headers) for maximum efficiency.\n\nUsinge the cache is a bit like Amazon S3: You need to supply both the entity (file) contents and any headers that you want to be sent with a HTTP response that's served from the cache. Also like S3, you can add content that has already been gzipped, making gzipping at a later stage unnecessary.\n\nThe main difference from S3 is that the cache does not have a concept of folders. All entities are uniquely identified by their resource path.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar ConnectEntityCache = require(\"connect-entity-cache\")\nvar connect = require(\"connect\")\n\nvar cache = new ConnectEntityCache({log: console.log})\ncache.cacheEntity(\"/\",new Buffer(\"Hello World\"),{\"content-type\":\"text/plain\"})\nvar app = connect()\napp.use(cache)\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can pass a log and a warn function to the `ConnectEntityCache` constructor in an options object, as `log` and `warn`, respectively. `log` defaults to a noop, `warn` defaults to `console.warn`.\n\n## Notes\n\n* connect-entity-cache uses [infer-entity-headers](https://github.com/meryn/infer-entity-headrs) to infer entity headers.\n* You can provide response headers you want to be sent along. These will always take precedence.\n* If you pass a string instead of a buffer as entity, then the string is assumed to be UTF-8.\n* You can cache gzipped entities. Just make sure you add `\"content-encoding\": \"gzip\"` to the headers.\n* There can be only one entity for each path. There is no content-negotiation.\n* There's currently no way to remove cached entities.\n* connect-entity-cache also properly responds to `HEAD` and `OPTIONS` requests.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe initial structure of this module was generated by [Jumpstart](https://github.com/meryn/jumpstart), using the [Jumpstart Black Coffee](https://github.com/meryn/jumpstart-black-coffee) template.\n\n## License\n\nconnect-entity-cache is released under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).  \nCopyright (c) 2013 Meryn Stol  ","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2013-04-26T22:49:16.049Z"},{"number":"0.0.2","date":"2013-04-26T22:59:44.154Z"}],"created":"2013-04-26T22:48:57.772Z","modified":"2013-04-26T22:59:44.154Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"meryn","email":"merynstol@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"meryn","email":"merynstol@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"connect-entity-cache","_npmUser":{"name":"meryn","email":"merynstol@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.2.18","_rev":"1-c96a97f2468f6d21d9974bff4227c8f1","author":{"name":"Meryn Stol","email":"merynstol@gmail.com"},"bugs":"https://github.com/meryn/connect-entity-cache/issues","directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"a506a63eb0113cbe0ba4799c9021bfff90c03a95","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/connect-entity-cache/-/connect-entity-cache-0.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"meryn","email":"merynstol@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-04-26T22:59:44.154Z","created":"2013-04-26T22:48:57.772Z","0.0.1":"2013-04-26T22:49:16.049Z","0.0.2":"2013-04-26T22:59:44.154Z"}}}
