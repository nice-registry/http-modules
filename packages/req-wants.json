Having tight control in your routes around content negotiation is one of the main reasons I prefer to avoid frameworks in general.\n\nThis module makes it easy to see what is happening in your code at the point you decide how you are going to respond and what `content-type` you are going to respond with.\n\n# EXAMPLE\n\n    var http = require('http')\n      , wants = require('req-wants')\n\n    http.createServer(function(req, res){\n\n      req.wants = wants(req, res)\n\n      if (req.wants('json')) {\n        res.writeHead(200, { 'content-type': 'application/json' })\n        res.write(JSON.stringify({ foo: 'bar' }))\n        return res.end()\n      }\n\n      // Assuming you are using beardo or Templar\n      if (req.wants('html')) return res.template('foo')\n\n      // don't want to support anything else.\n      res.statusCode = 415\n      res.end()\n    }\n\n    }).listen(1337)\n\nI think it's important to note that this decorator has seen several incarnations over several production projects and most of the code was initially borrowed from node-restify's req.accepts method. I think it could be a lot better though, maybe you could [help out](https://github.com/jxson/req-wants)?\n\n# DEVELOPMENT\n\nYou can run the tests through standard npm commands.\n\n    $ npm install   # install dependencies\n    $ npm test      # run the tests\n\n# CONTRIBUTING\n\nWant to help? Send a [pull request][pr], I'll give you commit access and we can make this better.\n\nIf a PR is too much any feedback is always welcome, I prefer [GH issues][issues] but a [tweet][twitter] or IRC chat is fine as well :)\n\n# LICENSE (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) Jason Campbell (\"Author\")\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
