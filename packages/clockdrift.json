But it occured to me that even with no access to the server, I could detect clock drift by examining the date stamp in HTTP headers from the server.\n\nSo, I wrote this tool to use in a crontab.\n\n## How do I install it?\n\n    npm install -g clockdrift\n\n## How do I use it?\n\n    clockdrift 15 http://www.example.com/ https://www.example.net/\n\nThe first argument is the drift tolerance in seconds. Clocks that are off from your local clock by less than the specified number of seconds (15 in the example above) will not be reported. Use `-1` to receive notices about all clocks even if they are set precisely.\n\nBy the way, since the tool uses your clock as the canonical clock, it's good to take steps to make sure that your system clock isn't the problem. I include the Naval Observatory clock URL at http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/ in my cron job to make sure that it's not my system clock that is off as opposed to the remote server clock.\n\nThe remaining arguments are the URLs that the tool should connect to in order to retrieve timestamps. In the example above, we are checking the clocks on `www.example.com` and `www.example.net`.\n\nThe tool assumes that you have a fast connection and/or are on a network that is nearby the servers you are checking. Therefore, a one second timeout is hardcoded. This insures against false positives due to slow network connections.","created":"2014-11-10T20:04:05.833Z","modified":"2014-11-10T20:04:05.833Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"trott","email":"rtrott@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"trott","email":"rtrott@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"clockdrift","_npmUser":{"name":"trott","email":"rtrott@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_rev":"1-289e6494c2f4b8f5631c10901b30dd5b","_shasum":"30b3b46108ea52062ae9a5a86b0866d73e332f6c","author":{"name":"Rich Trott","email":"rtrott@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Trott/clockdrift.js/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"30b3b46108ea52062ae9a5a86b0866d73e332f6c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/clockdrift/-/clockdrift-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"trott","email":"rtrott@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-11-10T20:04:05.833Z","created":"2014-11-10T20:04:05.833Z","1.0.0":"2014-11-10T20:04:05.833Z"}}}
