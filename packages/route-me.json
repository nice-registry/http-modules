Using route-me, you can define the behavior of your server by specifying a route using a RESTFUL method (currently only handles GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE), path, and callback function. Route-me will handle the rest!\n\n---\n\n## Installation\nOpen your favorite terminal and install the route-me framework via npm:\n```sh\n$ npm i route-me\n```\n\n---\n\n## Basic Use\nSimply require route-me as a dependency, and instantiate a new router to which you can add your own custom routes.\n\nDefine your custom routes within a separate module. For these examples, we are using the filename routes.js within the root directory of the application.  You will need to export the router at the bottom of the file, after definining the routes.  Then, require this module into your server file.\n\nfile: _routes.js_\n```javascript\nconst Router = require('route-me');\nconst router = new Router();\n// routes defined here\nmodule.exports = router;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Defining Routes\nCreate methods on your router by specifying a RESTFUL method in lowercase (.get, .post, .put, .patch, or .delete), a URL path (as a string), and callback function. This is the general template:\n\n__file: routes.js__\n```javascript\nconst Router = require('route-me');\nconst router = new Router();\n\nrouter.get('/testPath', function(req, res) {\n    res.write('Your message to the client here');\n    res.end();\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Using the routes within a server\nRequire in the routes file that you have created and pass a call to router.route into your server.\n\nfile: _server.js_\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst router = require('./routes'); //Wherever your routes are defined\n\nhttp.createServer(router.route())\n    .listen(3000);\n```\n\n---\n\n## Todos\n\n - Handle other RESTFUL methods beyond GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE\n - Handle many types of data\n - Enable responses beyond writing to the client\n\n\nLicense\n----\n\nMIT\n","created":"2016-05-21T22:52:53.075Z","modified":"2016-05-23T18:04:19.215Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"stefuhnee","email":"stefuhnee@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"dustinbm","email":"dustinbm@gmail.com"},{"name":"stefuhnee","email":"stefuhnee@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"route-me","_nodeVersion":"4.4.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/route-me-1.0.4.tgz_1464026656720_0.724223998375237"},"_npmUser":{"name":"stefuhnee","email":"stefuhnee@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.15.1","_rev":"1-64e27891c6fd5d709df53d1d61761cf7","_shasum":"c5986c93b63c332d9c665a9a4576687060e36dc3","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/stefuhnee/route-me/issues"},"directories":{"test":"mocha"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"c5986c93b63c332d9c665a9a4576687060e36dc3","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/route-me/-/route-me-1.0.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"dustinbm","email":"dustinbm@gmail.com"},{"name":"stefuhnee","email":"stefuhnee@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-05-23T18:04:19.215Z","created":"2016-05-21T22:52:53.075Z","1.0.0":"2016-05-21T22:52:53.075Z","1.0.1":"2016-05-21T23:07:30.898Z","1.0.2":"2016-05-23T16:13:08.239Z","1.0.3":"2016-05-23T16:23:07.243Z","1.0.4":"2016-05-23T18:04:19.215Z"}}}
