You can script your own server\nusing the `proxy` server API. Be sure to take a look at the \"Examples\" section\nbelow.\n\nThere is also a companion `proxy(1)` CLI tool, which spawns an HTTP(s) proxy\nserver with the specified options.\n\nYou could think of `proxy(1)` as similar to some of the other popular open\nsource HTTP proxy software:\n\n * [Squid][]\n * [Privoxy][]\n * [Apache][] with [`mod_proxy`][mod_proxy]\n * [Moreâ€¦](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Web_proxy_servers)\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install proxy\n```\n\nIf you would like to have the `proxy(1)` CLI program in your `$PATH`, then\ninstall \"globally\":\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install -g proxy\n```\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n#### Basic HTTP(s) proxy server\n\nA basic HTTP(s) server with all the default options. All requests are allowed.\nCONNECT HTTP method works as well.\n\n``` js\nvar http = require('http');\nvar setup = require('proxy');\n\nvar server = setup(http.createServer());\nserver.listen(3128, function () {\n  var port = server.address().port;\n  console.log('HTTP(s) proxy server listening on port %d', port);\n});\n```\n\n\nCLI Tool Examples\n-----------------\n\nThe `proxy(1)` CLI tool can be used to spawn HTTP(s) proxy server instances with\nvarious options.\n\n#### Port to bind to\n\nPass the `-p`/`--port` option to with a port number to specify a TCP port to\nbind to. Defaults to __3128__ if none is specified.\n\n``` bash\n$ proxy --port 8080\n```\n\n#### Custom `Proxy-Authenticate` command\n\nPass the `-a`/`--authenticate` switch with a command to execute when the client\n`Proxy-Authorization` header is given. This command determines whether or not the\nrequest is authorized based on the \"exit code\" of the command.\n\nThe relevant request authentication information is passed in as\n`PROXY_AUTH_USERNAME`, `PROXY_AUTH_PASSWORD` and `PROXY_AUTH_SCHEME` environment\nvariables.\n\nFor example, to authorize \"Basic\" authentication with username \"foo\" and\npassword \"bar\":\n\n``` bash\n$ proxy --authenticate 'if \\\n    [ \"$PROXY_AUTH_USERNAME\" = \"foo\" ] && \\\n    [ \"$PROXY_AUTH_PASSWORD\" = \"bar\" ]; \\\n      then exit 0; \\\n    fi; \\\n    exit 1;'\n```\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n\n[Squid]: http://www.squid-cache.org/\n[Privoxy]: http://www.privoxy.org/\n[Apache]: http://www.apache.org/\n[mod_proxy]: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html\n","created":"2017-02-01T13:48:09.515Z","modified":"2017-02-01T13:48:09.515Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"arunpusawant","email":"arunpusawant@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"arunpusawant","email":"arunpusawant@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"thisproxy2","_nodeVersion":"4.6.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/thisproxy2-0.2.4.tgz_1485956889277_0.4466846389696002"},"_npmUser":{"name":"arunpusawant","email":"arunpusawant@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.15.9","_rev":"1-6980bc612bc052ea1d8b2dae98db1619","_shasum":"4a103c2e3558bd956b53374d0b0031b7177e3b06","author":{"name":"Nathan Rajlich","email":"nathan@tootallnate.net","url":"http://n8.io/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"4a103c2e3558bd956b53374d0b0031b7177e3b06","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/thisproxy2/-/thisproxy2-0.2.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"arunpusawant","email":"arunpusawant@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-02-01T13:48:09.515Z","created":"2017-02-01T13:48:09.515Z","0.2.4":"2017-02-01T13:48:09.515Z"}}}
