HTTP Requester\n\nPerform HTTP & WS requests like a boss!\n\nA command line utility that supports HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket and server creation.\n\nIt features a cool interactive shell.\n\nIdeal for testing and debugging.\n\n* License: MIT\n* Current status: beta\n\n\n\n### Install\n\nDo not forget to install it **globally**:\n\n```\nnpm install -g http-requester\n```\n\n\n\n### Feature highlights:\n\n* HTTP, HTTPS and Websocket requests\n* Dummy HTTP and Websocket server creation\n* A cool interactive shell with history and auto-completion (even headers)\n* An interactive Websocket Chatter\n\n\n\n### *“Like a boss? Screenshot please!”*\n\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cronvel/http-requester/master/screenshot1.png)\n\n\n\n### Available command line options:\n\n* Without any argument, it runs the interactive shell\n* --help, -h: display help\n* --shell: run requests in an interactive shell, *like a boss!*\n* --method <method>: set the HTTP method\n* --protocol http|https|ws: set the protocol, 'http', 'https' or 'ws'\n* --host <host>: set the targeted host\n* --port <port number>, -p <port number>: set the targeted port, default is 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS)\n* --path <path>: set the path of the targeted resource in the host\n* --url <URL>: the full URL of the resource, will be splitted into protocol, host, port and path\n* --headers.* <header value>: any header can be specified as an option, e.g. --headers.content-type application/json.\n  If it is not conflicting with another options, it can be used without prefix,\n  like --content-type application/json\n* --headers <json string>: specify all headers using the JSON format\n* --auth \"<user>:<password>\": basic authentication i.e. \"user:password\" to compute an Authorization header\n* --timeout <ms>: set the request timeout in ms\n* --output <file>, -o <file>: if given, the body's response will be written to this file instead of STDOUT\n* --http: shortcut for --protocol http\n* --https: shortcut for --protocol https\n* --ws: shortcut for --protocol ws\n* --beautify, -b: beautify JSON body\n* --server: start a server\n* --config <file>: a JSON file containing all the above options, structured in an object\n\n**Syntactic sugar:**\n\n* `http-requester` launch the interactive shell, like `http-requester --shell`\n* `http-requester <file>` load a config file, like `http-requester --config <file>`\n* `http-requester <url>` GET the url, like `http-requester --method get --url <url>`\n* `http-requester <method> <url>` request the url, like `http-requester --method <method> --url <url>`\n\n\n\n### Available interactive shell commands:\n\n* **show** *or* **s**\n\n\tList the details of the request about to be performed.\n\n* **request** *or* **req**\n\n\tPerform the request.\n\t\n* &lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;][/&lt;path&gt;]\n\n\tParse the full URL and set the protocol, host, port and path.\n\n\tE.g.: `> http://localhost:8080/blog/index.html`\n\n* **host** &lt;hostname&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]\n\n\tSet the host and port to connect to.\n\n\tE.g.: `> host localhost:8080`\n\n* **port** &lt;port&gt;\n\n\tSet the port to connect to.\n\n* **protocol** http|https|ws\n\n\tSet the protocol to use.\n\n* **method** &lt;HTTP method&gt;\n\n\tSet the HTTP method.\n\n* **cd** &lt;path&gt;\n\n\tModify the path just like the shell 'cd' command does.\n\tStart the path with a '/' to set the absolute path, otherwise it moves relative to the current path.\n\tIt does **NOT** modify the query-string part of the URL.\n\n\tE.g.: `> cd blog` , `> cd ..` , `> cd ../../blog/index.html` , `> cd /index.html` , ...\n\n* **?** &lt;query string&gt;\n\n\tSet the query string part of the URL.\n\tUse a single `?` alone to erase the query string.\n\n\tE.g.: `> ?` , `> ?key=value` , `> ?key1=value1&key2=value2` , ...\n\n* headers.&lt;header&gt; &lt;value&gt;\n\n\tSet a HTTP header.\n\t\n\tE.g.: `> headers.Content-type: text/html`\n\n* &lt;header&gt;: &lt;value&gt;\n\n\tThe shortest way to set a HTTP header.\n\t\n\tE.g.: `> Content-type: text/html`\n\n* **auth** &lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;\n\n\tBasic authentication to compute an Authorization header.\n\n* **body** &lt;body string&gt;\n\n\tSet the body of the request.\n\n* **body**\n\n\tSet the body of the request, using the multi-line mode.\n\n* **timeout** &lt;ms&gt;\n\n\tSet the request timeout in ms.\n\n* **clear** [headers|auth|body]\n\n\tClear headers, auth or body, without argument: clear both.\n\n* **autoclear** [headers|auth|body]\n\n\tAutoclear headers, auth or body after each request, without argument: just check.\n\n* **autocookie**\n\n\tTurn autocookie on/off.\n\n* **beautify**\n\n\tTurn beautify on/off for JSON body.\n\n* **ls**\n\n\tList all known sub-resources of the current path, just like the UNIX 'ls' command does.\n\n\n\n\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-04-10T15:27:16.087Z","modified":"2017-03-18T20:48:47.905Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"cronvel","email":"cedric.ronvel@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"cronvel","email":"cedric.ronvel@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-requester","_nodeVersion":"6.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http-requester-0.12.5.tgz_1489870125841_0.1321871082764119"},"_npmUser":{"name":"cronvel","email":"cedric.ronvel@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"7-573114111e69311387e6174b3547208c","_shasum":"9cf068666265ee40c74ce41fe21c217db873c35f","author":{"name":"Cédric
