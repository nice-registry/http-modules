For now the orderbook is super basic, and\nthe trades are being streamed from a MongoDB database.\nSee the `TODO.md` for the next steps.\n","created":"2014-02-19T11:39:56.187Z","modified":"2014-02-19T11:39:57.760Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"czzarr","email":"stanislas.marion@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"czzarr","email":"stanislas.marion@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"mtgox-mock","_npmUser":{"name":"czzarr","email":"stanislas.marion@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.14","_rev":"1-b1cee5e44f8615b66737997267d7a081","author":{"name":"Stanislas Marion"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"48246810d0261265bce140d3c30a819bca6607ad","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/mtgox-mock/-/mtgox-mock-0.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"czzarr","email":"stanislas.marion@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-02-19T11:39:57.760Z","created":"2014-02-19T11:39:56.187Z","0.0.0":"2014-02-19T11:39:57.760Z"}}}
