Install homebridge using: npm install -g homebridge\n2. Install homebridge-http using: npm install -g homebridge-http\n3. Update your configuration file. See sample-config.json in this repository for a sample. \n\n# Configuration\n\nThis module has recently been updated to support an additional method to read the power state of the device and the brightness level. Specify the `status_url` in your config.json that returns the status of the device as an integer (0 = off, 1 = on). \n\nSpecify the `brightnesslvl_url` to return the current brightness level as an integer.\n\nSwitch Handling and brightness Handling support 3 methods, yes for polling on app load, realtime for constant polling or no polling\n\nConfiguration sample:\n\n ```\n\"accessories\": [ \n\t{\n\t\t\"accessory\": \"Http\",\n\t\t\"name\": \"Alfresco Lamp\",\n\t\t\"switchHandling\": \"realtime\",\n\t\t\"http_method\": \"GET\",\n\t\t\"on_url\":      \"http://localhost/controller/1700/ON\",\n\t\t\"off_url\":     \"http://localhost/controller/1700/OFF\",\n\t\t\"status_url\":  \"http://localhost/status/100059\",\n\t\t\"service\": \"Light\",\n\t\t\"brightnessHandling\": \"yes\",\n\t\t\"brightness_url\":     \"http://localhost/controller/1707/%b\",\n\t\t\"brightnesslvl_url\":  \"http://localhost/status/100054\",\n\t\t\"sendimmediately\": \"\",\n\t\t\"username\" : \"\",\n\t\t\"password\" : \"\"\t\t\t\t\t    \n       } \n    ]\n```\n\n#ToDo\n\nComplete documentation and review a number of  forks","starsCount":2,"created":"2016-09-15T13:37:45.136Z","modified":"2017-03-18T22:30:52.712Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"einarzt","email":"dreiplay@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"einarzt","email":"dreiplay@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"homebridge-custom-http","_nodeVersion":"6.6.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/homebridge-custom-http-0.1.7.tgz_1474380734529_0.16343819489702582"},"_npmUser":{"name":"einarzt","email":"dreiplay@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.7","_rev":"2-b8ee9ff6754b0f2ad586c7f340b01bda","_shasum":"5a347c2d5eb20ac3a25d04bd3cf59494c31485e0","author":{"name":"Martin"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/EinArzt/homebridge-custom-http/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"NovaGL"},{"name":"David Parry"},{"name":"Adrian Rudman"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.7"},"dist":{"shasum":"5a347c2d5eb20ac3a25d04bd3cf59494c31485e0","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/homebridge-custom-http/-/homebridge-custom-http-0.1.7.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"einarzt","email":"dreiplay@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-18T22:30:52.712Z","created":"2016-09-15T13:37:45.136Z","0.0.1":"2016-09-15T13:37:45.136Z","0.0.2":"2016-09-15T13:51:00.052Z","0.0.3":"2016-09-15T14:08:54.802Z","0.0.4":"2016-09-15T14:12:07.783Z","0.0.5":"2016-09-15T14:21:04.519Z","0.0.6":"2016-09-15T14:30:46.016Z","0.0.7":"2016-09-15T15:02:42.307Z","0.0.8":"2016-09-15T15:05:17.353Z","0.0.9":"2016-09-15T15:07:54.301Z","0.1.0":"2016-09-15T15:43:49.964Z","0.1.1":"2016-09-15T15:46:43.841Z","0.1.2":"2016-09-15T16:26:34.515Z","0.1.3":"2016-09-15T16:42:53.095Z","0.1.4":"2016-09-15T16:46:09.335Z","0.1.5":"2016-09-15T17:05:50.121Z","0.1.6":"2016-09-15T17:08:17.615Z","0.1.7":"2016-09-20T14:12:16.683Z"},"users":{"krital":true,"sziszi":true}}}
