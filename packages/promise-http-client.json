Results from HTTP requests are standard Q promises.\n\nCurrent features:\n\n- Supports GET, PUT, POST and DELETE verbs\n- Supports JSON requests and responses, with automatic marshalling and unmarshalling\n\nSee the *TODO* section below for the list of features not currently supported\n\nUsage\n=====\nUse npm to add the library as a dependency to your project:\n\n```npm install --save promise-http-client``\n\nExamples\n========\nHow to retrieve the Yahoo.com frontpage using the library:\n\n```\nvar PromiseHttpClient = require(\"promisehttpclient\"),\n    client = new PromiseHttpClient();\n\nclient.get(\"http://www.yahoo.com\").then(function(body) {\n    console.log(body);\n}).fail(function(err) {\n    console.log(\"There was an error retrieving the page: \" + err);\n});\n```\n\nSee the *examples/* folder for additional examples, including a JSON client.\n\nTesting\n=======\nUse ```grunt test``` to run the unit tests.\n\nUnit tests are built with Nock (https://github.com/pgte/nock), so the client is not hitting a live HTTP server but instead\na mocked one, which means that there may be real world scenarios where the client does not work as expected. Feel free to report an issue\nfor cases where the behaviour of the client is incorrect.\n\nTODO\n====\nThe following features are in the roadmap:\n\n- Support for HTTP 302 redirects\n- Implement the remaining HTTP methods (OPTIONS, PATCH, etc)\n- Gzipped requests and responses\n\nLicense\n=======\nApache License 2.0: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\n","description":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oscarrenalias/promise-http-client.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oscarrenalias/promise-http-client)","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2014-01-17T22:58:43.131Z"}],"starsCount":1,"created":"2014-01-17T22:58:35.385Z","modified":"2014-01-17T22:58:43.131Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"oscarrenalias","email":"oscar@renalias.net"},"owners":[{"name":"oscarrenalias","email":"oscar@renalias.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"promise-http-client","_npmUser":{"name":"oscarrenalias","email":"oscar@renalias.net"},"_npmVersion":"1.2.14","_rev":"1-c770ff631e374286cc74d4aacc2bd383","directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"66930565e7f761207a5124c0210f9d7c7f0e268c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/promise-http-client/-/promise-http-client-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"oscarrenalias","email":"oscar@renalias.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-01-17T22:58:43.131Z","created":"2014-01-17T22:58:35.385Z","0.1.0":"2014-01-17T22:58:43.131Z"},"users":{"luuhoangnam":true}}}
