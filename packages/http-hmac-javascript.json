Code changes should be made here.\n  * _demo/_ - Demo files to show how the library can be used.\n  * _hmac.js_ - The source file of the library.\n\n## Build\n\n* Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.\n* Make code changes in _src/_ directory.\n* In root directory, run ```gulp build-demo```. Alternatively, you can run ```gulp``` to keep gulp on watch to automatically compile/transpile all file changes.\n\n## Tests\n\n* Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.\n* In root directory, run ```gulp test``` to see the current test results. Alternatively, you can go to the _qunit/hmac.html_ page in your browser.\n","created":"2016-02-29T18:52:23.512Z","modified":"2017-04-19T21:24:41.801Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ynx","email":"yuanxie@live.ca"},"owners":[{"name":"nick.veenhof","email":"nick.veenhof@gmail.com"},{"name":"ynx","email":"yuanxie@live.ca"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-hmac-javascript","_nodeVersion":"6.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http-hmac-javascript-0.2.4.tgz_1492637079489_0.10193055379204452"},"_npmUser":{"name":"ynx","email":"yuanxie@live.ca"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"2-7fd72746e5b28d00adc853342c34d1b5","_shasum":"f90bcbaa4d2d990534db714221fbe697d5160d6c","author":{"name":"Acquia Lift Engineering"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/acquia/http-hmac-javascript/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"f90bcbaa4d2d990534db714221fbe697d5160d6c","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/http-hmac-javascript/-/http-hmac-javascript-0.2.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"nick.veenhof","email":"nick.veenhof@gmail.com"},{"name":"ynx","email":"yuanxie@live.ca"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-19T21:24:41.801Z","created":"2016-02-29T18:52:23.512Z","0.1.0":"2016-02-29T18:52:23.512Z","0.1.1":"2016-03-02T23:10:33.494Z","0.1.2":"2016-05-16T22:17:19.814Z","0.1.3":"2016-05-19T15:00:31.811Z","0.1.4":"2016-05-19T22:31:58.326Z","0.1.5":"2016-05-19T23:18:23.961Z","0.1.6":"2016-05-26T01:32:22.400Z","0.1.7":"2016-05-26T17:44:05.672Z","0.1.8":"2016-05-26T22:56:12.247Z","0.1.9":"2016-05-27T13:28:32.066Z","0.2.0":"2016-05-27T19:22:31.626Z","0.2.1":"2016-06-03T19:33:43.610Z","0.2.2":"2016-06-06T20:00:24.221Z","0.2.3":"2016-06-27T05:00:12.978Z","0.2.4":"2017-04-19T21:24:41.801Z"}}}
