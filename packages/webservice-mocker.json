Routes are the files which connects the request and the config. \n\n    {\n        \"GET:/api/v2/user\" : {\n            \"rule\" : \"./[path to file]/user.json\"\n        },\n        \"POST:/api/v2/user\" : {\n            \"rule\" : \"./[path to file]/login.json\"\n        },\n        \"GET:/api/v2/posts\" : {\n            \"data\" : {\n                \"request\" : {\n                    \"headers\" : {\n                        \"content-type\" : \"application/json\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"response\" : {\n                    \"headers\" : {\n                        \"content-type\" : \"application/json\"\n                    },\n                    \"statusCode\" : 200,\n                    \"payload\" : {\n                        \"posts\" : [\n                            {\n                                \"name\" : \"Post 1\"\n                            },\n                            {\n                                \"name\" : \"Post 2\"\n                            }\n                        ],\n                        \"message\" : \"Posts retrieved successfully\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        \"POST:/api/v2/user/:id/:name\" : {\n            \"data\" : {\n                \"request\" : {\n                    \"headers\" : {\n                        \"Content-Type\" : \"application/vnd.api+json\"\n                    },\n                    \"payload\" : {\n                        \"fake\" : \"data\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"response\" : {\n                    \"headers\" : {\n                        \"Content-Type\" : \"application/vnd.api+json\"\n                    },\n                    \"statusCode\" : 200,\n                    \"payload\" : {\n                        \"name\" : \":name\",\n                        \"id\" : \":id\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n[Note: The path should be relative from your app's root directory]\n[Note: You can have inline request/response definition as well]\n[Note: Now you can use variables in URL. Ofcourse the variables can be used in RESPONSE payload]\n\n(3) Create a http server, require the mocker and call the handle method like,\n\n    var http = require('http');\n    var mocker = require('webservice-mocker');\n\n    var server = http.createServer(function (req,res) {\n        // by default the routes will be searched in ./routes/routes.json\n        // use mocker.setRouteFile('path to the routes file') to over load with a different file\n\n        mocker.handle(req,res);\n    });\n\n    server.listen(8080);\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Note: If there is any error in loading the routes or config file, the response payload will have the error message.]\n\nAfter putting files in place, your project will look something similar to the below image. (ofcourse you can have custom folder name and file name)\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/2zFw3WO.png)\n\nor simply register your routes using get or post methods [Available from v0.4.0] like metioned below\n\n    var http = require('http');\n    var mocker = require(\"webservice-mocker\");\n    mocker.enableLogs(); // Should be the first method, so that all the actions will be logged.\n\n\n    var requestObject = {\n        \"headers\" : {\n            \"content-type\" : \"application/json\"\n        }\n    };\n\n    var responseObject = {\n        \"headers\" : {\n            \"content-type\" : \"application/json\"\n        },\n        \"statusCode\" : 200,\n        \"payload\" : {\n            \"links\" : [\n                {\n                    \"name\" : \"Link 1\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"message\" : \"Links retrieved successfully\"\n        }\n    };\n\n    var postReqObj = {};\n    postReqObj['headers'] = requestObject['headers'];\n    postReqObj['payload'] = {\n        \"name\" : \"cerlin\"\n    }\n    var postResObj = {};\n    postResObj['headers'] = responseObject['headers'];\n    postResObj['payload'] = {\n        \"links\" : [{\n            \"name\" : \"cerlin\"\n        }]\n    }\n\n    var getReqObj = {};\n    getReqObj['headers'] = requestObject['headers'];\n\n    var getNewResObj = {}; \n    getNewResObj['headers'] = responseObject['headers'];\n    getNewResObj['payload'] = {\n        \"links\" : [{\n            \"name\" : \"cerlin\",\n            \"id\" : \":id\"\n        }]\n    }\n\n    mocker\n        .get('/api/v2/links', requestObject, responseObject)\n        .post('/api/v2/links', postReqObj, postResObj)\n        .get('/api/v2/user/:id', getReqObj, getNewResObj);\n\n    var server = http.createServer(function (req,res) {\n\n        // use mocker.enableCors() to enable Cross Domain Request Sharing.\n        // If CORS is enabled, the server will respond for requests with OPTIONS as method.\n        mocker.handle(req,res);\n\n    });\n\n    server.listen(8080);\n\n\nThis Mocker exposes Ten methods\n\n1. `mocker.handle(request, response)`. \n    Method to handle the request. This method validates header and payload then return the response which is mentioned in routes.json\n\n2. `mocker.setRouteFile('path to the routes file')`. \n    Method to force the app to read a different route file\n\n3. `mocker.get(url, requestObj, responseObj)`. \n    This method registers your GET request over the rules in routes file. (ie, if routes file is present then this rule will be appended with that else this rule standalone). This method can be used if you dont want to create any routes file and rules/config files. This method should be called before `handle` method\n    [Please refer the example above for request/response structure]\n\n4. `mocker.post(url, requestObj, responseObj)`. \n    This method registers your POST request over the rules in routes file. (ie, if routes file is present then this rule will be appended with that else this rule standalone). This method can be used if you dont want to create any routes file and rules/config files. This method should be called before `handle` method\n    [Please refer the example above for request/response structure]\n\n5. `mocker.register(method, url, requestObj, responseObj)`. \n    This method can be used to register GET or POST or PUT. Previous two methods will call this method internally. \n    [Please refer the example above for request/response structure]\n\n6. `mocker.enableCors()`.\n    This method is to enable Cross Domain Request Sharing . [Available from v0.5.0]\n\n7. `mocker.disableCors()`.\n    This method is to disable Cross Domain Request Sharing . [Available from v0.5.0]\n\n8. `mocker.enableLogs()`.\n    This method is to enable logs to be written in console. [Available from v0.6.0]. This method should be called just after requiring all the packages.\n\n9. `mocker.disableLogs()`.\n    This method is to disable logs to be written in console. [Available from v0.6.0]\n\n10. `mocker.setDefaultResponse(responseObj)`.\n    This method is to override the default response given by the mocker. `responseObj` should be in the same structure as in response object passed in `mocker.get`. [Available from v0.8.0]\n\n###Change Log:\n####v0.8.4\n1. Update dependencies to accept latest patch version\n2. Removed dev dependency badge from the document\n\n####v0.8.3\n1. Minor refactor\n2.
