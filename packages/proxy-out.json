This is useful if you're working in a corporate space, behind a corporate proxy.\n\n### Whitelisting\n\nSometimes, you'll want to route to internal destinations and won't want them running through a proxy (A proxy won't know how to get back to your localhost, for instance). In this situation, you can add a whitelist by supplying the hostnames as an array like so:\n\n```\nvar whitelist = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', 'my-site.local'];\nrequire('proxy-out')('http://my.proxy.com:80', whitelist);\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nTesting actually attempts to connect to an external site (Google.com), so you'll need a working proxy. By default, test.js checks for the environment variable `http_proxy`.\n\n```\nexport http_proxy=http://my.proxy.com:80\nnpm test\n```\n","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2014-02-20T19:56:44.379Z"},{"number":"0.0.2","date":"2014-02-20T22:32:52.698Z"},{"number":"0.0.3","date":"2014-02-21T23:41:51.926Z"},{"number":"0.0.4","date":"2014-02-21T23:45:35.250Z"},{"number":"0.0.5","date":"2014-02-22T00:23:07.906Z"},{"number":"0.0.6","date":"2014-02-22T22:15:30.150Z"},{"number":"0.0.7","date":"2014-03-27T00:32:20.101Z"},{"number":"0.0.8","date":"2014-04-17T00:06:05.593Z"},{"number":"0.0.9","date":"2014-10-16T17:52:56.242Z"},{"number":"0.0.10","date":"2014-10-22T19:01:33.660Z"},{"number":"0.0.11","date":"2014-10-23T22:34:19.323Z"},{"number":"0.0.12","date":"2014-10-23T22:44:11.491Z"},{"number":"0.0.13","date":"2014-12-18T22:22:40.725Z"}],"starsCount":1,"created":"2014-02-20T19:56:44.379Z","modified":"2014-12-18T22:22:40.725Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ryanrowland","email":"ryan.w.rowland@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"ryanrowland","email":"ryan.w.rowland@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"proxy-out","_npmUser":{"name":"ryanrowland","email":"ryan.w.rowland@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.16","_rev":"1-1c883224d69063dac104cf8122cdabae","_shasum":"8203ffbd42878feffd0fa2bcfb6abb7858c22ad8","author":{"name":"Ryan Rowland"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ryan-rowland/proxy-out/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"James J.
