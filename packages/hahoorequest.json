Isomorphic request to work in Node or in the browser. For example React isomorphism, the same code for the server and the browser.\n\n## Why\n* Different libraries use different syntax, the replacement library will lead to a large number of changes\n* The browser and the server can use the same code for different libraries. For example: the browser with [reqwest](https://github.com/ded/reqwest), the server with [request](https://github.com/request/request). Or both the browser and the server are using fetch.\n\n## Install\n```\nnpm install hahoorequest --save\n```\n## Import library\nSelect the library you want to use\n### Browser & Server\n\n##### Browser with fetch, Server with fetch\n```\nimport request from 'hahoorequest/lib/fetch';\n```\n##### Browser with fetch, Server with request\n```\nimport request from 'hahoorequest/lib/fetch-request';\n```\n##### Browser with reqwest, Server with fetch\n```\nimport request from 'hahoorequest/lib/reqwest-fetch';\n```\n##### Browser with reqwest, Server with request\n```\nimport request from 'hahoorequest/lib/reqwest-request';\n```\n##### Browser with superagent, Server with superagent\n```\nimport request from 'hahoorequest/lib/superagent';\n```\n##### Browser with superagent, Server with fetch\n```\nimport request from 'hahoorequest/lib/superagent-fetch';\n```\n##### Browser with superagent, Server with request\n```\nimport request from 'hahoorequest/lib/superagent-request';\n```\n### Browser\n\n##### [fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch)\n```\nimport request from 'hahoorequest/lib/whatwg-fetch';\n```\n##### [reqwest](https://github.com/ded/reqwest)\n```\nimport request from 'hahoorequest/lib/reqwest';\n```\n##### [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent)\n```\nimport request from 'hahoorequest/lib/superagent';\n```\n### Server\n\n##### [node-fetch](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch)\n```\nimport request from 'hahoorequest/lib/node-fetch';\n```\n##### [request](https://github.com/request/request)\n```\nimport request from 'hahoorequest/lib/node-request';\n```\n## Usage\nReturn Promises\n```javascript\nrequest({\n  url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hahoocn/hahoorequest/master/test/test.json',\n  method: 'GET',\n  type: 'json'\n})\n.then((res) => {\n  console.log(res.body);\n});\n```\n## Options\n* `url` a fully qualified uri\n* `method` http method (default: `GET`)\n* `headers` http headers\n* `body` entity body for `PATCH`, `POST` and `PUT` requests. Must be a query `String` or `JSON` object\n* `type` a string enum. `html`, `xml`, `json`, `form`, `png`... (default: `json`)\n* `qs` object containing querystring values to be appended to the url\n* `credentials` Sending cookies. fetch set credentials option. if credentials is not undefined, reqwest and superagent will add `withCredentials = true`\n\n## Response\n* `response.body` Content of response\n* `response.status` http status code\n\n## Errors\n* `response.errcode` Code of errors\n* `response.errmsg` Content of errors\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2016-06-26T07:53:10.375Z","modified":"2017-01-09T11:21:33.667Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"hahoo","email":"ihahoo@163.com"},"owners":[{"name":"hahoo","email":"ihahoo@163.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"hahoorequest","_nodeVersion":"6.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/hahoorequest-0.6.2.tgz_1483960893430_0.8544264822266996"},"_npmUser":{"name":"hahoo","email":"ihahoo@163.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.0.5","_rev":"3-12b6df5d14e5edb3caf7e9ae964839ab","_shasum":"3b23ce76fdb0af4c46c968f1afc15ae5162ddba8","author":{"name":"Ray Guo"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hahoocn/hahoorequest/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.6.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"3b23ce76fdb0af4c46c968f1afc15ae5162ddba8","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hahoorequest/-/hahoorequest-0.6.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"hahoo","email":"ihahoo@163.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-09T11:21:33.667Z","created":"2016-06-26T07:53:10.375Z","0.1.0":"2016-06-26T07:53:10.375Z","0.1.1":"2016-06-26T08:54:48.142Z","0.1.2":"2016-06-27T11:24:12.822Z","0.2.0":"2016-06-28T17:33:13.934Z","0.3.0":"2016-06-29T02:54:19.612Z","0.4.0":"2016-06-29T12:52:54.667Z","0.5.0":"2016-06-29T16:09:15.052Z","0.5.1":"2016-07-29T15:52:49.875Z","0.5.2":"2016-08-07T16:47:21.110Z","0.6.0":"2016-10-11T18:14:31.464Z","0.6.1":"2017-01-09T08:04:28.962Z","0.6.2":"2017-01-09T11:21:33.667Z"},"users":{"hahoo":true}}}
