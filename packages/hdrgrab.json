For example:\n\n  > hdrgrab 8000 eth0\n  \nand in some cases, you may need permission to listen to the device, making \nthe appropriate command line something like:\n\n  > sudo hdrgrab 8000 eth0\n\n\n\n## Installation Problems?\n\n### libpcap\n\nIf npm complains about problems with pcap, like this:\n\n    npm ERR! Failed at the pcap@0.2.7 install script.\n\nit usually means that it couldn't find libpcap when building. See the\ninstructions here: <https://github.com/mranney/node_pcap>. \n\nOn my OSX machine, I have to build like this (becoming root first):\n\n  > CXXFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include npm -g install hdrgrab\n  \nbecause my pcap headers are in a non-standard place (thanks to MacPorts). \nYMMV.\n\n\n## Contact\n\nMark Nottingham <mnot@mnot.net>\n\nhttp://github.com/mnot/hdrgrab/\n\n\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2012-10-15T02:51:30.814Z"},{"number":"0.2.0","date":"2012-11-03T12:20:48.938Z"},{"number":"0.2.1","date":"2012-11-03T12:33:46.917Z"}],"created":"2012-10-15T02:51:26.824Z","modified":"2012-11-03T12:33:46.917Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mnot","email":"mnot@mnot.net"},"owners":[{"name":"mnot","email":"mnot@mnot.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"hdrgrab","_npmUser":{"name":"mnot","email":"mnot@mnot.net"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.63","_rev":"1-30bce44b24f4f50ef5f7a9babda3bf7c","author":{"name":"Mark Nottingham","email":"mnot@mnot.net","url":"http://www.mnot.net/"},"bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/mnot/hdrgrab/issues"},"contributors":[],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"b3807fbc4a9b1c4f3c246db8ab84ee89ed8f8f2c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hdrgrab/-/hdrgrab-0.2.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mnot","email":"mnot@mnot.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2012-11-03T12:33:46.917Z","created":"2012-10-15T02:51:26.824Z","0.1.0":"2012-10-15T02:51:30.814Z","0.2.0":"2012-11-03T12:20:48.938Z","0.2.1":"2012-11-03T12:33:46.917Z"}}}
