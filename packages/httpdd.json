Same goes for [Sean Cribbs](https://twitter.com/seancribbs), not only behind Basho's Webmachine, but also behind [Webmachine-Ruby](https://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby).\n\n* [Lo√Øc Hoguin](https://twitter.com/lhoguin) and his [cowboy](https://github.com/extend/cowboy) for working in the same direction, but with [a less sexy outcome](https://raw.github.com/nevar/cowboy/a597393265d9d69df3f9b0fe660087a208e86641/guide/rest_flow_diagram.svg) :)\n\n* [Philipp Meier](https://twitter.com/ordnungswprog) and his [clojure-liberator](http://clojure-liberator.github.com/) for working in the same direction, but with [a less sexy outcome](http://philipp.meier.name/t/liberator-flow-color.png) :)\n\n* [Stephane Bortzmeyer](https://twitter.com/bortzmeyer), another straight thinker, for coming up with [Cosmogol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bortzmeyer-language-state-machines)\n\n### Others\n\n* [Cyril Rohr](https://twitter.com/crohr) - http://crohr.me/journal/2011/http-status-codes-flowchart.html\n\n\n## License\n\n[Apache 2.0](LICENSE)\n","homepage":"https://github.com/for-GET/http-decision-diagram","versions":[{"number":"4.0.201309","date":"2013-10-30T08:00:08.897Z"}],"created":"2013-10-30T08:00:03.717Z","modified":"2013-10-30T08:00:08.897Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"andreineculau","email":"andrei.neculau@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"andreineculau","email":"andrei.neculau@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"httpdd","_npmUser":{"name":"andreineculau","email":"andrei.neculau@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.13","_rev":"1-1732a8303f9c0e3b7dd832bbcb9789cc","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/for-GET/http-decision-diagram/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"4.0.201309"},"dist":{"shasum":"73c435a5ede30ec0477d5998def1ebc45a012d71","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/httpdd/-/httpdd-4.0.201309.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"andreineculau","email":"andrei.neculau@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-10-30T08:00:08.897Z","created":"2013-10-30T08:00:03.717Z","4.0.201309":"2013-10-30T08:00:08.897Z"}}}
