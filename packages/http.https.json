Please note that you will need an SSL certificate to run these examples.  A temporary, self-signed certificate can be generated as follows:\n```\ncd examples\n\nopenssl genrsa -out example.key 2048\nopenssl req -new -out example.csr -key example.key\nopenssl x509 -req -in example.csr -signkey example.key -out example.crt\n\n```\n\nThe example depends on Express and SocketIO.  These can be installed as follows:\n\n```\ncd examples\n\nnpm install\nnpm start\n\n```\n\nWhen the server is running, you can test by going to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) in your browser.\n","created":"2017-04-23T21:30:31.988Z","modified":"2017-04-23T21:42:24.873Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ordishs","email":"simon.ordish@me.com"},"owners":[{"name":"ordishs","email":"simon.ordish@me.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http.https","_nodeVersion":"7.1.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http.https-1.0.3.tgz_1492983744328_0.1477502784691751"},"_npmUser":{"name":"ordishs","email":"simon.ordish@me.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.9","_rev":"4-8215150662b27bb4960db61c2ff4ee30","_shasum":"5ee49c3ec6c9634d24042f0479b8dca3c76c0d99","author":{"name":"Simon Ordish","email":"simon.ordish@masagi.co.uk","url":"http://masa.gi"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ordishs/http.https/issues"},"directories":{"example":"examples"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"5ee49c3ec6c9634d24042f0479b8dca3c76c0d99","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/http.https/-/http.https-1.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ordishs","email":"simon.ordish@me.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-23T21:42:24.873Z","created":"2017-04-23T21:30:31.988Z","1.0.0":"2017-04-23T21:30:31.988Z","1.0.1":"2017-04-23T21:38:29.245Z","1.0.2":"2017-04-23T21:40:46.103Z","1.0.3":"2017-04-23T21:42:24.873Z"}}}
