Spotter will asynchronously send HTTP HEAD requests\nand list the returned HTTP response statuscode for each URL.\n\nThis project relies on [request-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise),\n[lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) and [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird).\n\nStatus: Currently under development.\n\n## Command line tool\n\n### Installation\n\nYou can install spotter locally via `$ npm install spotter` or as a global package via `$sudo npm install -g spotter`.\n\nOr just clone this repository:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/netsensei/spotter.git\n$ sudo npm link\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nYou have a CSV file with a 'url' column which contains a number of url's.\n\n```bash\n$ spotter list.csv --column url\n```\n\nThe CSV file will be overwritten. The original data will be kept, but an\nadditional column \"response\" will be added. This column holds the HTTP resonse\ncode.\n\n## API\n\nUse spotter in your own code like this:\n\n```javascript\nvar spotter = require('spotter');\nvar options = {\n  pace: false,\n  followRedirect: true,\n  maxRedirects: 3\n}\nvar column = \"url\";\n\nvar data = [\n  { title: \"CNN\", url: \"http://cnn.com\" },\n  { title: \"NY Times\", url: \"http://nytimes.com\" }\n]\n\nspotter(data, column, options).then(function(result) {\n  // do stuff\n}\n```\n\nThis method accepts the following `options`\n\n* `pace`: set to true or false. Display the [pace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pace) progress bar (default: false).\n* `followRedirect`: set to true or false. Follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: true)\n* `maxRedirects`: the maximum number of redirects to follow (default: 3)\n\n## FAQ\n\nQ: Spotter throws this error:\n\n`(node) warning: possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit.`\n\nA: The [request](https://github.com/request/request) library has created too many event listeners which are still active or haven't been cleaned up by Node. See: [this issue](https://github.com/request/request/issues/311) for an detailled explanation.\n\nQ: How many redirects does Spotter follow?\n\nBy default, Spotter follows 3 redirects (3xx codes).\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Matthias Vandermaesen\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
