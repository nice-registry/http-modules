Custom query parser? Yes, you can!\n- Universal - make HTTP requests in Node and the browser with the same API\n- Custom backends - you want to use your own HTTP backend? No problems!\n- Easy to use - you'll be up and running in less than 5 minutes\n- Familiar API - regardless what's the previous HTTP client you've used\n- Promise & callback-style API\n\n### Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install hurricane --save\n```\n\nhurricane depends on [ES 2015 Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).\nIf you are using the library in an environment that doesn't support them, you must introduce a polyfill.\n\n### Quick Introduction\n\nTBD\n\n### Documentation\n\nTBD\n\n### Adapters\n\nhurricane currently supports the following adapters:\n\n- [isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) - Isomorphic WHATWG Fetch API, for Node & Browserify\n- [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/) - Ajax with less suck - (and node.js HTTP client to match)\n- [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js\n\nYou can also write your own adapter very easily. Follow the documentation.\n\nPRs for adding support for new adapters will be highly appreciated! There is only one\nrequirement - the adapter should work both in Node.js and in browser environments.\n\nIf the adapter that you want to contribute works only in Node.js or only in the\nbrowser, consider making it a plugin. We'll be happy to help!\n\n## Plugins\n\nTBD\n\n### Contributing\n\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub. This project is intended to be a\nsafe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere\nto the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct.\n\n### Credits\n\nhurricane is heavily influenced by [Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday).
