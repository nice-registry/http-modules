All proxies are validated before being made available for use. When the function is first called it will load the list of proxies, and delay calling back with a proxy until at least 30 proxies are validated. I proxy is deemed invalid if no response is received within 8 seconds. Each time the function is called a random proxy is returned.\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2013-07-28T04:39:06.781Z"}],"created":"2013-07-28T04:39:05.558Z","modified":"2013-07-28T04:39:06.781Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"curious-attempt-bunny","email":"hitechbunny@myopera.com"},"owners":[{"name":"curious-attempt-bunny","email":"hitechbunny@myopera.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"proxies","_npmUser":{"name":"curious-attempt-bunny","email":"hitechbunny@myopera.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.2.15","_rev":"1-6289e5e2a86f9810c0478dadba926610","author":{"name":"Merlyn Albery-Speyer"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"4b4ec8ef824ea1c66c05f72759ab6bc2b3443b3b","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/proxies/-/proxies-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"curious-attempt-bunny","email":"hitechbunny@myopera.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-07-28T04:39:06.781Z","created":"2013-07-28T04:39:05.558Z","0.0.1":"2013-07-28T04:39:06.781Z"}}}
