This can be used in conjunction with an ESP8266 for instance or an Arduino with an ethernet shield. I will add an example Arduino script in the future.\n\n## Installation\n\nRun the following command\n```\nnpm install -g homebridge-http-motion-sensor\n```\n\nChances are you are going to need sudo with that.\n\n## Config.json\n\nThis is an example configuration\n\n```\n\"accessories\" : [\n    \n    {\n        \"accessory\": \"http-motion-sensor\",\n        \"name\": \"Hallway Motion Sensor\",\n        \"port\": 18089,\n        \"serial\" : \"E642011E3ECB\",\n        \"repeater\" : [\n                {\n                    \"host\" : \"192.168.2.11\",\n                    \"port\" : \"22322\",\n                    \"path\" : \"/turnonscreentilltimeout\",\n                    \"auth\" : \"username:password\"\n                }\n            ]\n    }\n]    \n```\n\n| Key           | Description                                                                        |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| accessory     | Required.

This will appear in your homekit app         |\n| port         | Required. The port that you want this plugin to listen on. Choose a number above 1024. |\n| serial         | Optional. Assigns a serial number. Not really required but I would advise in making up some arbitrary string. |\n| repeater         | Optional. Whenever the http server setup by this plugin is hit, it will also make a request to each entry in this array. I am using it to turn on a screen in my hallway.
