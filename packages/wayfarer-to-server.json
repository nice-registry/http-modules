See\n  [`routington.define()`](https://github.com/pillarjs/routington#nodes-node--routerdefineroute)\n  for all options.\n- __methods__: a nested router or an object containing methods. Method keys\n  must be HTTP verbs, `any` or `all`.  See\n  [`methodist`](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/methodist) for the full\n  documentation. Methods are lowercased before matched.\n\n### router(route, req, res)\nMatch a route and execute the corresponding callback. Alias: `router.emit()`.\n\n## FAQ\n### why did you build this?\nServer routers are inherently more complex than client routers because of the\nnecessity to handle HTTP methods. `wayfarer-to-server` extends the\n[`wayfarer`](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/wayfarer) router to match HTTP\nmethods and delegate `req, res` objects while maintaining its composable nature\nand fast [`radix trie`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree) core.\n\n### why not use existing server routers?\nMost routers have strong opinions on how applications should be structured.\nThese opinions are expressed in features such as: middleware helpers, error\nhandlers, control flow constructs or even mutating the `err, req` objects. Some\nof these features might be desireable to have in an application, but shouldn't\nbe included in a router.\n\n## See Also\n- [wayfarer](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/wayfarer)\n- [methodist](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/methodist)\n\n## License\n[MIT](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license)\n\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/wayfarer-to-server.svg?style=flat-square\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/wayfarer-to-server\n[travis-image]: https://img.shields.io/travis/yoshuawuyts/wayfarer-to-server/master.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/yoshuawuyts/wayfarer-to-server\n[codecov-image]: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/yoshuawuyts/wayfarer-to-server/master.svg?style=flat-square\n[codecov-url]: https://codecov.io/github/yoshuawuyts/wayfarer-to-server\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/wayfarer-to-server.svg?style=flat-square\n[downloads-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/wayfarer-to-server\n[standard-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[standard-url]: https://github.com/feross/standard\n","created":"2015-08-10T08:35:38.289Z","modified":"2015-09-13T16:01:41.554Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"yoshuawuyts","email":"i@yoshuawuyts.com"},"owners":[{"name":"yoshuawuyts","email":"i@yoshuawuyts.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"wayfarer-to-server","_nodeVersion":"3.2.0","_npmUser":{"name":"yoshuawuyts","email":"i@yoshuawuyts.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.13.3","_rev":"1-18ab1d8def37f619cb80d4314131b188","_shasum":"9e108fbc9b272c4e8be1bbcf252c340dd88374e5","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/wayfarer-to-server/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"9e108fbc9b272c4e8be1bbcf252c340dd88374e5","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/wayfarer-to-server/-/wayfarer-to-server-2.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"yoshuawuyts","email":"i@yoshuawuyts.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-09-13T16:01:41.554Z","created":"2015-08-10T08:35:38.289Z","1.0.0":"2015-08-10T08:35:38.289Z","1.0.1":"2015-08-10T08:37:47.781Z","1.0.2":"2015-08-11T00:30:52.552Z","1.0.3":"2015-08-11T14:46:04.189Z","1.0.4":"2015-08-13T06:17:34.424Z","2.0.0":"2015-08-23T05:29:09.230Z","2.0.1":"2015-08-24T02:37:34.615Z","2.0.2":"2015-09-06T01:55:23.346Z","2.1.0":"2015-09-13T16:01:41.554Z"}}}
