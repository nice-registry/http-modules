Its development stemmed from the desire to test funtionality that was dependent on the result of API service requests, without having to rely on said service's uptime.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nYou will need to install [redis] and start `redis-server`.  When that is done, go ahead and install `nockpoint` via `npm` like so:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm install nockpoint\r\n```\r\n\r\nFire it up by executing:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ nockpoint [options]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n`-p` is the port to utilize (defaults to 8080)\r\n\r\n`-r` is the redis host:port (defaults to localhost:6379)\r\n\r\n`-s` will suppress logging\r\n\r\n`-h` displays usage information\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nYou can utilize either the native API functionality to add/remove endpoints or directly interact with [redis] itself for expedience.  The below is an example of just using a series of curl requests:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ nockpoint -p 8081 -s &\r\n$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/np/status\r\n{\"endpoints\":5}\r\n\r\n$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/np/add/get/test/12 -d '{\"code\":202, \"headers\":[\"User-Agent: n/a\"], \"response\":\"{\\\"result\\\":\\\"This is a message from a mocked endpoint.\\\"}\"}'\r\n\"GET:/test/12\"\r\n\r\n$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/np/status\r\n{\"endpoints\":6}\r\n\r\n$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/test/12 -v\r\n> GET /test/12 HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: localhost:8081\r\n> Accept: */*\r\n>\r\n< HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\r\n< User-Agent:  n/a\r\n<\r\n{\"result\":\"This is a message from a mocked endpoint.\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## API\r\n### POST: /np/add/&lt;type&gt;/&lt;endpoint&gt;\r\nCreates a new mock endpoint and returns its [redis] hash key.\r\n\r\n### DELETE: /np/remove/&lt;type&gt;/&lt;endpoint&gt;\r\nRemoves an existing mock endpiont.\r\n\r\n### POST: /np/shutdown\r\nCauses the server to \"gracefully\" die.\r\n\r\n### GET: /np/status\r\nProvides information on the number of existing endpoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Daniel Khodaparast\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
