If `undefined` or `null`, the `body` is returned as a `Buffer`. If `detect`, the `body` is still returned as a `Buffer`, but the `res` object will have extra fields for HTML responses: `charset` and `charsets`.\n\n* `'gzip'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: request and receive compressed content encodings from the server.\n\n**safety**\n\n* `'timeout'` *(number, default: `undefined`)*: number of milliseconds to wait for a response to end, `undefined` means to limit.\n\n* `'rejectUnauthorized'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: requires SSL certificates be valid.\n\n**size**\n\n* `'bodyMinLength'` *(number, default: `undefined`)*: minimum response body size in bytes, `undefined` means to limit.\n\n* `'bodyMaxLength'` *(number, default: `undefined`)*: maximum response body size in bytes, `undefined` means to limit.\n\n* `'bodyAllowPartial'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: return truncated body for responses exceeding the `bodyMaxLength` limit.\n\n**type**\n\n* `'responseCodeFilter'` *(number or array, default: `undefined`)*: only accept responses with the provided status codes, `undefined` means to limit.\n\n* `'responseTypeFilter'` *(string, default: `undefined`)*:  only accept responses matching (or containing) the provided MIME type sub string, `undefined` means to limit.\n\n* `'responseAllowEmptyType'` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: accept responses without MIME types while `responseTypeFilter` is enabled.\n\n* `'responseSignatureFilter'` *(string or array, default: `undefined`)*: only accept responses with the provided byte signatures, `undefined` means to limit.\n\n---\n\n#### callback\n\n`callback` returns the response object as the second argument `res` with these fields:\n\n* `'headers'` *(object)*: the response headers.\n\n* `'statusCode'` *(number)*: the response status code.\n\n* `'elapsed'` *(number)*: total time usage in milliseconds.\n\n* `'complete'` *(boolean)*: `true` if the response body is complete.\n\n* `'charset'` *(string)*: the best guess of the HTML charset, requires `encoding = \"detect\"`.\n\n* `'charsets'` *(array)*: all charset candidates with confidence scores, requires `encoding = \"detect\"`.\n\n* `'redirected'` *(number)*: total redirected times.\n\n* `'redirects'` *(array)*: full redirect history.\n\n* `'href'` *(string)*: the last URL (after all redirects).\n\n* `'address'` *(string)*: remote IP address.\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT
