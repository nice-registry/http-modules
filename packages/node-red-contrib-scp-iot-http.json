It supports a lot of features/options for advanced usage. \n\nA simple example : The node-red-contrib-http-request module support HTTPS on HTTP proxy using CONNECT request. This is not feasible using the Core Node-RED HTTP Request module.  \n\nBy contributing to our http request node, you'll be supporting an evolutive and robust HTTP client for Node-RED. \n\n","created":"2017-06-19T09:14:31.575Z","modified":"2017-06-19T09:14:31.575Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"iotchallenge","email":"lukas.schoemig@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"iotchallenge","email":"lukas.schoemig@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-red-contrib-scp-iot-http","_nodeVersion":"6.11.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/node-red-contrib-scp-iot-http-0.1.0.tgz_1497863670493_0.2807343229651451"},"_npmUser":{"name":"iotchallenge","email":"lukas.schoemig@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"1-3507d80f8c8215a66509418da49567dc","_shasum":"f9ac1e0f927c5a7f55858c657c6028c49a0b2830","author":{"name":"Hannes Keil","email":"hannes.keil@sap.com","url":"https://sap.com"},"contributors":[{"name":"Hannes Keil","email":"hannes.keil@sap.com","url":"https://sap.com"},{"name":"Lukas Schoemig","email":"lukas.schoemig@sap.com","url":"https://sap.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"f9ac1e0f927c5a7f55858c657c6028c49a0b2830","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/node-red-contrib-scp-iot-http/-/node-red-contrib-scp-iot-http-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"iotchallenge","email":"lukas.schoemig@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-19T09:14:31.575Z","created":"2017-06-19T09:14:31.575Z","0.1.0":"2017-06-19T09:14:31.575Z"}}}
