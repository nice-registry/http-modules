It takes two configuration options:\n\n  * `port` The port number the server should respond to. Default is *8080*.\n\n  * `contentType` The content type the server will send. Default is *text/html*.\n\nOptions should get passed in as an Object.\n\n\n## Development\nThe project scaffold includes unit test framework, and other QA tools, but they are not set up yet. This might happen eventually, but this module is not yet ment for production usage.\n\n\n## License\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Martin Gausby\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
