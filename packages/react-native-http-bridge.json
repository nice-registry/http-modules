Created for [Status.im](https://github.com/status-im)\n\n## Install\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save react-native-http-bridge\n```\n\n## Automatically link\n\n#### With React Native 0.27+\n\n```shell\nreact-native link react-native-http-bridge\n```\n\n## Example\n\nFirst import/require react-native-http-server:\n\n```js\n\n    var httpBridge = require('react-native-http-bridge');\n\n```\n\n\nInitalise the server in the `componentWillMount` lifecycle method. You need to provide a `port` and a callback where requests will be captured. Currently there is no way to return responses.\n\n```js\n\n    componentWillMount(){\n\n      // initalize the server (now accessible via localhost:1234)\n      httpBridge.start(5561, function(request) {\n\n          // request.url\n          // request.postData\n\n      });\n\n    }\n\n```\n\nFinally, ensure that you disable the server when your component is being unmounted.\n\n```js\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    httpBridge.stop();\n  }\n\n```\n","created":"2017-02-07T11:06:20.245Z","modified":"2017-05-24T09:18:44.180Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"alwx","email":"alwxndr@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"alwx","email":"alwxndr@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"react-native-http-bridge","_nodeVersion":"7.7.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/react-native-http-bridge-0.4.1.tgz_1495617523054_0.2656843918375671"},"_npmUser":{"name":"alwx","email":"alwxndr@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.1.2","_rev":"6-a3da1e6eec4f690891c8d009720c29fd","_shasum":"d120a25b23fb98ec708def75fef5489d79173e81","author":{"name":"Alexander Pantyukhov"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/alwx/react-native-http-bridge/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.4.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"d120a25b23fb98ec708def75fef5489d79173e81","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/react-native-http-bridge/-/react-native-http-bridge-0.4.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"alwx","email":"alwxndr@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-24T09:18:44.180Z","created":"2017-02-07T11:06:20.245Z","0.2.0":"2017-02-07T11:06:20.245Z","0.2.1":"2017-02-07T11:24:47.273Z","0.2.2":"2017-02-08T14:38:04.009Z","0.3.0":"2017-04-22T10:00:14.572Z","0.4.0":"2017-05-22T11:26:30.528Z","0.4.1":"2017-05-24T09:18:44.180Z"}}}
