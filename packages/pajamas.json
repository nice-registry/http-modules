the current url is assumed\n      , dataType : 'json'                   // optional; 'json' is assumed\n      , data     : {                        // optional; null is assumed\n          whatever : 'you want'\n        }\n      , type   : 'GET'                    // optional; 'GET' is assumed\n    })\n\nThen, you can do whatever you'd normally do with a Q promise, such as:\n\n    promise.\n      then(function (value) {\n        // do something with the JSON\n      }, function (error) {\n        // error.message is of the form \"<method> <url>: <status code> <status text>\"\n      })\n\nPOSTing your data is done in the exact same way as the GET, just change the `type` option to `\"POST\"`.\n\nIf you set the `dataType` to `'*'`, the promise will be resolved with the XHR object.\n\n\nOptions\n-------\n\nAll parameters must be passed in as properties of a settings object.\n\n\n### `crossDomain`\n\nA cross-domain request can be forced by setting this value to `true`.\n\n*Default*: inferred from URL\n\n\n### `data`\n\nData sent to the server.\nThis data is converted to a query string if it is not already a string.\nTo avoid processing the data, set the `processData` option to `false`.\n\n*Default*: null\n\n\n### `dataType`\n\nThe type of data that you are expecting to receive back from the server.\nValid options include \n'json', 'jsonp', 'script', 'text', 'html', 'xml', and '*'.\nThere is an attempt to infer the data type before the request is sent,\nbut it is not extremely sophisticated.\n\n*Default*: 'json' if no inference is made\n\n\n### `delay`\n\nThe amount of time in milliseconds to wait to send the request.\nThis can be useful when simulating latency.\n\n\n### `headers`\n\nA map of header key/value pairs to send along with the request.\nThese key/value pairs may override the defaults like\n'Accept', 'Content-Type', and 'X-Requested-With'.\n\n*Default*: `{}` (depends on data type)\n\n\n### `timeout`\n\nThe number of milliseconds to wait before aborting the request.\nFor scripts (including JSONP), this will cause the script tag to be removed from the DOM.\n\n\n### `type`\n\nThe type of request to make ('GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE').\n\n*Default*: 'GET'\n\n\n### `url`\n\nThe URL to which the request is sent.\n\n*Default*: The current page\n\n\n### `xhr`\n\nA function to generate your own XMLHttpRequest.\nThis can be extremely useful when mocking your remote calls.\n\n\nAMD\n---\n\nPajamas declares 'q' as it's sole dependency.\nTherefore, if q.js is not discoverable, you will likely need to define a path.\nSee [amd-test.js](https://github.com/geowa4/pajamas/blob/master/test/amd/amd-test.js) for an example.\n\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\nIf you would like to build Pajamas on your own you will need to do the following.\n\n1. `npm install`\n1. `npm test`\n\nAlternatively, you can install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) globally.\nIn the project directory, you will still need to run `npm install` to install all local dependencies.\nThen, you may freely run any Grunt command defined in grunt.js.\n\n\nRoadmap\n-------\n\nThe following is what it will take for me to call v1.0\n\n\n### v0.1 (COMPLETE)\n\nThis lib needs more tests; a grunt build to automate them would be nice.\nCurrently, I have only tested GET requests for JSON in a non-AMD environment.\nI need to test POST, parsing JSON when `window.JSON` is not present, and much more.\n\n### v0.1.1 (COMPLETE)\n\nTest with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/).\nTest in FF (latest) and IE9.\n\n### v0.2 (COMPLETE)\n\nPlain text support.\n\n### v0.3 (COMPLETE)\n\nHTML support.\n\n### v0.4 (COMPLETE)\n\nXML support.\n\n### v0.5 (COMPLETE)\n\nJS support.\n\n### v0.6 (COMPLETE)\n\nDefault parser (`Accepts: *`).\nBetter tests with mock XHR.\n\n### v0.7 (COMPLETE)\n\nJSONP support; crossOrigin scripts\n\n### v0.8 (COMPLETE)\n\nValidate and document `processData` option.\nExpose `param`, `serialize`, and `serializeArray` functions.\n\n### v0.9 (COMPLETE)\n\nHandle timeouts.\n\n### v0.10\n\nEnder support.\n\n### v1.0?\n\nUse this for my own website.\nOther criteria TBD.\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nPajamas is based upon \n@[ded](https://github.com/ded)'s [Reqwest](https://github.com/ded/reqwest) AJAX library\nand [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery).\n","versions":[{"number":"0.9.0","date":"2012-11-14T04:00:24.238Z"},{"number":"0.10.0","date":"2012-11-19T04:08:10.016Z"},{"number":"1.0.0","date":"2012-11-21T03:59:31.105Z"},{"number":"1.0.1","date":"2012-11-25T02:34:11.879Z"},{"number":"1.0.2","date":"2012-11-25T02:39:50.400Z"},{"number":"1.1.0","date":"2012-11-27T02:56:35.639Z"},{"number":"1.1.1","date":"2012-11-27T03:08:16.200Z"},{"number":"1.1.2","date":"2012-12-28T20:42:40.793Z"},{"number":"1.2.0","date":"2012-12-29T23:00:11.032Z"},{"number":"1.3.0","date":"2012-12-31T20:52:51.526Z"},{"number":"1.3.1","date":"2012-12-31T22:36:53.653Z"},{"number":"1.3.2","date":"2013-01-02T01:49:47.148Z"},{"number":"1.3.4","date":"2013-01-11T12:28:11.570Z"},{"number":"1.3.5","date":"2013-01-11T12:36:35.937Z"},{"number":"1.4.1","date":"2013-03-13T11:37:23.172Z"},{"number":"1.4.2","date":"2013-04-08T03:23:43.572Z"},{"number":"1.4.3","date":"2013-04-08T03:37:18.121Z"},{"number":"1.5.0","date":"2013-05-22T16:51:30.617Z"},{"number":"1.5.2","date":"2013-05-26T04:29:25.021Z"},{"number":"1.5.3","date":"2013-06-21T13:37:11.344Z"},{"number":"1.5.4","date":"2013-11-03T16:00:11.015Z"},{"number":"1.6.0","date":"2013-11-03T17:56:08.811Z"}],"created":"2012-11-14T04:00:22.720Z","modified":"2013-11-03T17:56:08.811Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"geowa4","email":"g.w.adams.iv@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"geowa4","email":"g.w.adams.iv@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"pajamas","_npmUser":{"name":"geowa4","email":"g.w.adams.iv@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.5","_rev":"1-3a6da3c3ff9376740e09395b0cd540b1","author":{"name":"George Adams IV","url":"http://gada.ms"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/geowa4/pajamas/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.6.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"a25ec2eb95349a975c7da6e1019afc02c1621cdd","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/pajamas/-/pajamas-1.6.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"geowa4","email":"g.w.adams.iv@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-11-03T17:56:08.811Z","created":"2012-11-14T04:00:22.720Z","0.9.0":"2012-11-14T04:00:24.238Z","0.10.0":"2012-11-19T04:08:10.016Z","1.0.0":"2012-11-21T03:59:31.105Z","1.0.1":"2012-11-25T02:34:11.879Z","1.0.2":"2012-11-25T02:39:50.400Z","1.1.0":"2012-11-27T02:56:35.639Z","1.1.1":"2012-11-27T03:08:16.200Z","1.1.2":"2012-12-28T20:42:40.793Z","1.2.0":"2012-12-29T23:00:11.032Z","1.3.0":"2012-12-31T20:52:51.526Z","1.3.1":"2012-12-31T22:36:53.653Z","1.3.2":"2013-01-02T01:49:47.148Z","1.3.4":"2013-01-11T12:28:11.570Z","1.3.5":"2013-01-11T12:36:35.937Z","1.4.1":"2013-03-13T11:37:23.172Z","1.4.2":"2013-04-08T03:23:43.572Z","1.4.3":"2013-04-08T03:37:18.121Z","1.5.0":"2013-05-22T16:51:30.617Z","1.5.2":"2013-05-26T04:29:25.021Z","1.5.3":"2013-06-21T13:37:11.344Z","1.5.4":"2013-11-03T16:00:11.015Z","1.6.0":"2013-11-03T17:56:08.811Z"}}}
