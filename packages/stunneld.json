Only use stunneld services that you trust. :D\n\nEven though the traffic is encrypted end-to-end, you can't just trust any stunneld service\nwilly-nilly.\n\nA man-in-the-middle attack is possible using Let's Encrypt since an evil stunneld service\nwould be able to complete the http-01 and tls-sni-01 challenges without a problem\n(since that's where your DNS is pointed when you use the service).\n\nAlso, the traffic could still be copied and stored for decryption is some era when quantum\ncomputers exist (probably never).\n","created":"2017-04-04T18:31:44.399Z","modified":"2017-06-06T23:31:53.493Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tigerbot","email":"slgibelyou@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"tigerbot","email":"slgibelyou@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"stunneld","_nodeVersion":"7.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/stunneld-0.9.0.tgz_1496791913334_0.7575942757539451"},"_npmUser":{"name":"tigerbot","email":"slgibelyou@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.0","_rev":"4-d762efb5cbb735679b329e0cd81a78dd","author":{"name":"AJ ONeal","email":"coolaj86@gmail.com","url":"https://coolaj86.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Daplie/node-tunnel-server/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.9.0"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-+CJ357Cjm7feH6dvJDnmg+SxyxsYDk+M2h/bapWdcrKLgJ8RxNGN7tfKKfPLxqiIF1Juwrge4SYmBAeahaT4/w==","shasum":"d14de2b3bf65414435ec1160e00d89ac42b9e110","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/stunneld/-/stunneld-0.9.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tigerbot","email":"slgibelyou@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-06T23:31:53.493Z","created":"2017-04-04T18:31:44.399Z","0.8.1":"2017-04-04T18:31:44.399Z","0.8.2":"2017-04-05T16:59:03.773Z","0.8.3":"2017-04-10T17:42:19.029Z","0.9.0":"2017-06-06T23:31:53.493Z"}}}
