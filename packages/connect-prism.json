It's basically an HTTP cache, but for developers working on a Single Page Application (SPA).\n\nIt's useful for mocking complex & high latency API calls during development.  It's also useful when writing e2e tests for your SPA only, removing the server from the equation.  This results in much faster execution of your e2e test suite.\n\nPrism works by adding a custom connect middleware to a the [connect](https://www.npmjs.org/package/connect) middleware server.\n\n### Modes\n\nThere are currently 4 supported modes of operation.\n\n#### Record\n\nThe record mode will allow you to both record and proxy all HTTP traffic for a certain endpoint on your connect development server.  For example, if in production your API sits at an endpoint `/api` then you may be currently proxying requests to a server you're hosting locally on another port or to an integration machine somewhere else.  You may have also attempted to mock out services that make HTTP calls in your client side code itself.  While in record mode you can navigate your application and trigger all the types of API calls you would like to have recorded.  Prism will then listen for responses and serialize them to disk.  When you want to read these responses instead of proxying traffic to the real server you shutdown and switch to the 'mock' mode.\n\nTo make mocks more readable, responses with a content-type of `json` or `javascript` will have their data stringified as an object.  If the content-type is anything other than json or if stringification fails then it falls back to a string.\n\nIf the server returns a compressed response (gzip or deflate are supported), then prism will decompress the payload when recording the response.\n\nExample mock generated:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"requestUrl\": \"/api/ponies\",\n  \"contentType\": \"application/json\",\n  \"statusCode\": 200,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"text\": \"my little ponies\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Mock\n\nThe mock (read) mode will listen for requests to a certain endpoint.  When a request matches an endpoint it will attempt to find a previously recorded response in the directory you defined mocks to be saved in (./mocks by default).  \n\n##### Stubbing new mocks\n\nIf a matching response is not found then prism will return a 404.  Prism will also create a mock during a 404.  This is useful when you want to mock API endpoints that may not exist yet.  To avoid having the subsequent request from returning the generated empty mock, the file has a .404 extension.  To use the mock, populate it with the appropriate values and remove the .404 extension.  This feature was contributed by [Miloš Mošovský](https://github.com/MilosMosovsky).\n\n#### Mock & Record\n\nAs its name implies this operation will mock and record.  This mode will first attempt to load a mock if one exists.  If a mock does not exist it will then proxy the request and record the response instead of returning a 404.\n\n#### Proxy\n\nAnd finally, prism supports simple proxying in much the same way as the [grunt-connect-proxy](https://github.com/drewzboto/grunt-connect-proxy) plugin works.  In fact, this plugin is heavily inspired by that project.  While in proxy mode, listening events for recording and mocking are disabled.\n\n### Adding the middleware to connect\n\nSimple add the middleware to your connect instance as in the example.  You can configure prism before or after the middleware is added.\n\n```js\nvar connect = require('connect');\nvar prism = require('connect-prism');\n\nprism.create({\n  name: 'api',\n  context: '/api',\n  host: 'localhost'\n});\n\nvar app = connect()\n  .use(prism.middleware)\n  .use(connect.static('public'))\n  .use(function(req, res){\n    res.end('hello world\\n');\n  })\n\nhttp.createServer(app).listen(3000);\n```\n\n### Using connect-prism with Grunt.js\n\nIf you're using grunt then head on over to the [grunt-connect-prism](http://github.com/seglo/grunt-connect-prism) page for more details.  For a sample configuration see the [Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/seglo/prism-sample-project/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) in the [prism-sample-project](https://github.com/seglo/prism-sample-project).\n\n### Using connect-prism with gulp\n\nIf you're using gulp then you would just use the core library along with gulp.  For a sample configuration see the [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/seglo/prism-sample-project/blob/master/gulpfile.js) in the [prism-sample-project](https://github.com/seglo/prism-sample-project).\n\n## Configuration \n\n### Setting up prism\n\nTo initialize a prism instance call prism.create.  You can call prism.create more than once to run multiple configurations.\n\n```js\nvar prism = require('connect-prism');\n\nprism.create({\n  name: 'api',\n  mode: 'record',\n  context: '/api',\n  host: 'localhost',\n  port: 8090\n});\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### mode\n\nType: `String`\n\nDefault: `'proxy'`\n\nValues: `'record'` | `'mock'` | `'proxy'` | `'mockrecord'`\n\nBy setting a mode you create an explicit declaration that the context you're proxying will always be in the configured mode.  You can optionally override the mode of all the proxies for a target by passing in a 3rd parameter to the prism grunt task prism:[target]:[mode]\n\ni.e. `grunt prism:server:mock`\n\n#### mocksPath\n\nType: `String`\n\nDefault: `'./mocks'`\n\nPath to the root directory you want to record and mock responses.  If the directory does not exist then prism will attempt to create it.  If prism is executed with a target then recorded and mocked responses will be read from `'./mocks/targetName'`.  If no target is defined then only the default prism options will be used.\n\n#### context\n\nType: `String`\n\nDefault: n/a\n\nThe starting context of your API that you are proxying.  This should be from the root of your webserver.  All requests that start with this context string will be used.\n\n#### host\n\nType: `String`\n\nDefault: n/a\n\nThe server name or IP of the API that you are proxying.\n\n#### port\n\nType: `Integer`\n\nDefault: n/a\n\nThe port number of the API that you are proxying.\n\n#### https\n\nType: `Boolean`\n\nDefault: false\n\nThe http scheme of the API you are proxying.  `true` === `https`, `false` === `http`\n\n#### delay\n\nType: `String` or `Integer`\n\nDefault: 0\n\nValues: A number in milliseconds | `'auto'` | `'fast'` | `'slow'`\n\nDelay will work with all modes.\n\nThis option allows you to simulate a delay when returning a mock response to the user.  Sometimes it's handy to simulate a delay because this will give you a better impression of how the user experience of your app will be when fully integrated with a backend server.\n\nYou can configure an exact delay in milliseconds or one of the precreated options which returns a random delay in a certain range.\n\n* auto: 500 to 1750 ms\n* fast: 150 to 1000 ms\n* slow: 1500 to 3000 ms\n\nThanks again to [Miloš Mošovský](https://github.com/MilosMosovsky) for this feature.\n\n#### rewrite\n\nType: `Object`\n\nDefault: `{}`\n\nAdd rewrite rules that prism will apply to all requests.  This functionality was copied from [grunt-connect-proxy and works the exact same way](https://github.com/drewzboto/grunt-connect-proxy#optionsrewrite).  You can configure a list of rewrite rules with an object.\n\n```js\n{\n  '^/removingcontext': '',\n  '^/changingcontext': '/anothercontext'\n}\n```\n\n#### headers\n\nType: `Object`\n\nDefault: `{}`\n\nA map of headers to be added to proxied requests.\n\n#### hashFullRequest\n\nType: `Boolean`\n\nDefault: `false`\n\nUse the request body in conjunction with the request URL in order to generate a unique hash for the serialized response.  This is useful when you want to record responses for requests with distinct request bodies.\n\ni.e.) Require two different responses for a POST a request with a payload in the request body.\n\nThanks to [Matt Philips](https://github.com/mattp-) for requesting and helping get this feature implemented.\n\n#### mockFilenameGenerator\n\nType: `Function` | `String`\n\nDefault: `'default'`\n\nUse one of the builtin or your own strategy to generate and read mock response filenames.  \n\nBuiltin generators:\n\n##### default\n\n`'default'`\n\nGenerates filenames strictly based on request URL and request body (when `hashFullRequest` is configured).  Generates a SHA1 hash.\n\ni.e.)\n\n```\n04d5d366d8e8dbea60bb9187f7610423a527ca24.json\n```\n\n##### humanReadable\n\n`'humanReadable'`\n\nGenerates a somewhat readable filename based on the request URL.  The request URL will replace characters `/ ? < > \\ : * | \" \\`.  A hash from the `'default'` generator is appended to the end of the scrubbed request URL.  The filename is truncated to 255 characters for maximum compatibility across filesystems.\n\ni.e.)\n\n```\n_is_this_url_really=that&readable=at&all_09b2ed55fb2b388fbe02c69e94bca5d86ff7247c.json\n```\n\n##### A Custom Function\n\nThis function accepts a function that takes 2 parameters:\n\n1. The prism config associated with this request context.\n2. The request object.\n\ni.e.) Generate a filename based on the SHA1 hash of the request URL.\n\n```js\nfunction(config, req) {\n  var crypto = require('crypto');\n  var path = require('path');\n\n  var shasum = crypto.createHash('sha1');\n  shasum.update(req.url);\n  return shasum.digest('hex');\n}\n```\n\n#### mockFilenameMaxLength\n\nThe maximum length of the generated readable filename. Long filenames can cause issues on Windows and Linux systems\nup to the point where the project cannot be checked out anymore because of the long mock filenames.\n\n##### default\n`255`\n\n\n#### ignoreParameters\n\nType: `Boolean` or [] of String or Regular expression\n\nDefault: `false`\n\nThis will filter parameters out of both the saved requestUrl and the hash used in the default file generation algorithm. This allows users to replay requests which use for example today's date or a random number as query parameters.\n\n#### clearOnStart\n\nType: `Boolean`\n\nDefault: `false`\n\nClear the `mocks/target` directory when prism is initialized.  The mocks directory will only be cleared of `.json` and `.json.404` files and is not recursive.  The mocks directory will only be cleared when in `record` or `mockrecord` modes.\n\n#### proxyConfig\nType: `Object`\n\nDefault:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    options: {\n       target: // absolute URL as defined by config https, host, port, and context, override at your own risk\n       xfwd: false, // don't add x-forward headers\n       secure: false, // don't verify SSL certs\n       prependPath: false // don't prepend path to target context when proxying\n    },\n    onProxyCreated: function(proxyServer, prismConfig) { ... } // By default this is a no-op, can be used to attach to events on the proxyServer\n}\n```\n\nAllows configuration of the internal proxyServer to meet more custom proxy needs, see [documentation](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy) for further details. This is for advanced use-cases only and can cause prism to stop working if misconfigured, you have been warned.\n\n#### shouldRecord\nType: `Function`\nReturns: `Boolean`\n\nDefault: `null`\n\nUser defined function that recieves the request and response objects and allows for user defined function to determine whether or not a particular request/response should result in a recording stored\n\nExample:\n\n```javascipt\n{\n  name: 'api',\n  mode: 'record',\n  context: '/api',\n  host: 'localhost',\n  port: 8090\n  shouldRecord: function (req, res) {\n      return res.statusCode !== 401;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### recordHeaders\nType: `Array` or `Boolean`\n\nDefault: `false`\n\nAllows recorded mocks to store specific headers that match the given header name array or all headers if set to true.  Note that the `Content-Type` and `Location` headers are always recorded.\n\n\n## API\n\n### Overview\n\nPrism has a REST API you can enable at run time.  This allows you to change, create, or remove prism configuration without having to update config files.  Some common use cases:\n\n* Switch to a different mode (i.e. mock to record)\n* Override mocked responses while testing\n\nTo enable the API call the `useApi()` function of the root prism object.\n\n```javascript\nvar prism = require('connect-prism');\n\nprism.useApi();\n```\n\n### API features\n\nWhen the API is enabled you can access it with the `/_prism` base path of your connect server.\n\n#### Version\n\n`GET` `/_prism/version`\n\nReturns the version of `connect-prism` curreently running.  i.e.) 1.0.0\n\n#### Set mode\n\n`POST` `/_prism/setmode/:prism_name/:mode`\n\n`prism_name`: The [`name`](#name) of the prism configuration.\n\n`mode`: The [`mode`](#mode) you want to switch to.\n\n#### Create prism instance\n\n`POST` `/_prism/create`\n\nExample Request body\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"name\": \"createTest\",\n  \"mode\": \"proxy\",\n  \"context\": \"/test\",\n  \"host\": \"localhost\",\n  \"port\": 8090\n}\n```\n\nAny valid prism configuration can be sent in the request body.  Some validation errors are returned to the caller.  To assist in troubleshooting you should enable verbose logging when running prism and watch the console.\n\n#### Remove prism instance\n\n`POST` `/_prism/remove/:prism_name`\n\n`prism_name`: The [`name`](#name) of the prism configuration.\n\n#### Override a mock with a new response\n\n`POST` `/_prism/override/:prism_name/create`\n\n`prism_name`: The [`name`](#name) of the prism configuration.\n\nExample Request body\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"mock\": {\n    \"requestUrl\": \"/test\",\n    \"contentType\": \"text/plain\",\n    \"statusCode\": 200,\n    \"data\": \"an overidden server response\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `mock` object is the prism mock response that will be populated in the override.  This is the same as the mock responses that connect prism generates.  To see an example of the contents of a mock response see the [Record](#record) mode configuration.\n\nPrism will create a mock response with the extension `.override` to differentiate it from other mock responses.\n\n##### Fake request parameters for a mock\n\nSometimes prism is configured in a way where it requires more than just the `requestUrl` of the mock response to generate a mock.  For example, when you use the [`hashFullRequest`](#hash-full-request) feature it will also use the request body to generate the mock response filename.  When using the [`mockFilenameGenerator`](#mock-filename-generator) it's possible to use any other property of the request object (i.e. http VERB).\n\nIn order to support this capability when overriding mock responses you can also include a fake request (see the [http.IncomingMessage](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_incomingmessage) documentation for properties of a request).\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"req\": {\n    \"url\": \"/test\",\n    \"method\": \"GET\",\n    \"body\": \"i like cheese\"\n  },\n  \"mock\": {\n    \"requestUrl\": \"/test\",\n    \"contentType\": \"text/plain\",\n    \"statusCode\": 200,\n    \"data\": \"an overidden server response\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Remove an overriden mock response\n\n`POST` `/_prism/override/:prism_name/remove`\n\n`prism_name`: The [`name`](#name) of the prism configuration.\n\nDeletes the override mock response from the file system.  Doing this will allow you to call the originally recorded mocked.\n\n#### Clear all overriden mock responses\n\n`POST` `/_prism/override/:prism_name/clear`\n\n`prism_name`: The [`name`](#name) of the prism configuration.\n\nDeletes all the overrides (mock responses with a `.override` extension in the prism `mocksPath` directory).\n\n### Logging\n\nTo enable verbose logging you need to call `useVerboseLog()`.  Prism uses the [`winston`](https://github.com/flatiron/winston) logging library.\n\n```javascript\nvar prism = require('connect-prism');\nprism.useVerboseLog();\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTry to stay within conventions already laid out in project.
