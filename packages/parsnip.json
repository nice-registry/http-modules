{"name":"parsnip","version":"0.1.2","description":"Digging up node.js's C HTTP parser for you to chew on.","license":"MIT","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"./node_modules/.bin/mocha"},"repository":"https://github.com/nathanaschbacher/parsnip","dependencies":{},"devDependencies":{"mocha":"*","should":"*"},"keywords":["http","parsing","parser","parse","native","parsnip"],"engines":{"node":">=0.8.x"},"readme":"## Overview\n\nThis project was born out of a desire to have a stable, reliable, and fast HTTP parser available for ad-hoc use.\n\nParsnip uses the same native C parser that node.js's HTTP module does.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install parsnip\n\n## Usage\n####Parsnip.parse( *raw_http_data, [http_code]* )\n\nGiven the following raw_http_data:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Mon, 19 Jul 2004 16:18:20 GMT\nServer: Apache\nLast-Modified: Sat, 10 Jul 2004 17:29:19 GMT\nETag: \"1d0325-2470-40f0276f\"\nContent-Length: 9\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\n{\"hey\":5}\n```\n\nYou can parse it using:\n\n```\nvar parsnip = require('parsnip');\n\nvar all_parsed = parsnip.parse(raw_http_data);\nconsole.log(all_parsed);\n```\n\n>```\n{\n    headers: {\n        date: 'Mon, 19 Jul 2004 16:18:20 GMT',\n        server: 'Apache',\n        'last-modified': 'Sat, 10 Jul 2004 17:29:19 GMT',\n        etag: '\"1d0325-2470-40f0276f\"',\n        'content-length': '9',\n        connection: 'close',\n        'content-type': 'text/plain'\n    },\n    statusCode: 200,\n    versionMajor: 1,\n    versionMinor: 1,\n    shouldKeepAlive: false,\n    upgrade: false,\n    body: < Buffer 7b 22 68 65 79 22 3a 35 7d 0d 0a >\n}\n>```\n\nAdditionally, the optional `http_code` parameter is for the case when your `http_raw_data` does not include a first protocol line, such as `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`.  By passing in an `http_code` value the proper protocol line will be added to the beginning of the `http_raw_data` before parsing begins.  If you set `http_code` to `404` the line `HTTP/1.1 404 Object Not Found` would be inserted at the beginning of your `http_raw_data` value.  This can be useful when using parsnip to process _'multipart/mixed'_ segments where each segment is missing the protocol line at the start. \n\n## Tests\n\nThe test suite can be run by simply:\n\n    $ cd /path/to/parsnip\n    $ npm install -d\n    $ npm test\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Nathan Aschbacher\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Nathan LaFreniere\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
