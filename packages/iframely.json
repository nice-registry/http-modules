The API covers well [over 1800 domains](https://iframely.com/domains) through 200 custom domain plugins and generic parsers for [oEmbed](http://oembed.com/), [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), powered by Iframely's whitelist. \n\nThe whitelist file is pulled from iframely.com and is updated automatically. You can also [have your own whitelist](https://iframely.com/docs/whitelist-format) file. The whitelisting is manual process, and we do every-day manual regression testing to ensure integrity. [Submit your domain](https://iframely.com/qa/request), if you publish embeds.\n\nHTTP API are available as [oEmbed](https://iframely.com/docs/oembed-api) or [Iframely API](https://iframely.com/docs/iframely-api) formats. To make it simple to understand, Iframely format mimics the `<head>` section of the page with its `meta` and `links` elements.\n\nIn response to `url` request, APIs returns you the embeds and meta for a requested web page. Below are data samples from [hosted API](https://iframely.com), just to show you the format:\n\n- [>> Hereâ€™s API call for Coub video](http://iframe.ly/ACcM3Y.json)\n- [>> Same one, but as oEmbed](http://iframe.ly/ACcM3Y.oembed)\n\nIframely can also be used as Node.js library. \n\nRequires Node version 0.10.22 and up. \n\n## Get started:\n\nTo get started with the APIs: \n\n - There's a hosted version of these APIs at [iframely.com](https://iframely.com), if you'd rather rely on the cloud\n - [How to install & configure](https://iframely.com/docs/host) your Iframely host.  \n - [API in Iframely format](https://iframely.com/docs/iframely-api)\n - [API in oEmbed format](https://iframely.com/docs/oembed-api)\n - [About Link Rels, Types and Media Queries](https://iframely.com/docs/links) in Iframely format (players, thumbnails, app, reader, survey, slideshow, etc)\n - [META semantics](https://iframely.com/docs/meta) Iframely API scrapes for you.\n\n\n\n## Contribute\n\nWe put our best effort to maintain Iframely and all its domain parsers. Please, feel free to [reach us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/iframely) or to [submit an issue](https://github.com/itteco/iframely/issues) if you have any suggestions. Our support email is support at iframely.com\n\nFork and pull-request, if you'd like to add more plugins and/or contribute fixes or improvements. By doing so, you make your work available under the same MIT license.\n\nIf you see an error in our domains whitelist (you can [debug URLs here](http://iframely.com/debug)), please ping us and we'll fix it in no time.\n\n\n## License & Authors\n\nMIT License.
