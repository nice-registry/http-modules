No user data is exposed, as it is the consumer that has access to the protected resource.\n\nIt works as https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-http-oauth but skips the access_token verification step and accepts empty access_tokens.\n\nThe cose base is 98% https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-http-oauth but adapted for the 2-legged scenario. So thanks jaredhanson for all work!.\n\n","created":"2016-05-11T19:31:16.277Z","modified":"2016-05-11T19:31:16.277Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"cthorne66","email":"cthorne@cthorne.com"},"owners":[{"name":"cthorne66","email":"cthorne@cthorne.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"passport-http-2legged-oauth-strategy","_nodeVersion":"4.3.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/passport-http-2legged-oauth-strategy-0.0.1.tgz_1462995074774_0.17404736299067736"},"_npmUser":{"name":"cthorne66","email":"cthorne@cthorne.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.20","_rev":"1-0f1a7d0a74a28d4b0f8a95e193850e0d","_shasum":"c9ac3b2109b8de72d0d962b236a0bd4945121daa","author":{"name":"Chris Thorne","email":"cthorne@cthorne.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/cthorne66/passport-http-2legged-oauth/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"c9ac3b2109b8de72d0d962b236a0bd4945121daa","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/passport-http-2legged-oauth-strategy/-/passport-http-2legged-oauth-strategy-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cthorne66","email":"cthorne@cthorne.com"}],"readmeFilename":"","time":{"modified":"2016-05-11T19:31:16.277Z","created":"2016-05-11T19:31:16.277Z","0.0.1":"2016-05-11T19:31:16.277Z"}}}
