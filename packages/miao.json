Just the browser will do.\r\n* The client device will need to be able to connect to a web server (a.k.a the proxy server) that can be accessed via a domain or a static IP address.\r\n* The proxy server only needs to host static page. (GitHub pages would do)\r\n\r\n## How does this work\r\n\r\n1. All necessary information (i.e. all possible IP addresses of the server) required for resolving the service address will be encoded and attached to the proxy page's URL as its hash.\r\n\r\n2. The URL is distributed to other devices (e.g. scanned via QR code)\r\n\r\n3. A proxy page runs a script in the client's browser, decodes the hash, tests connection for all possible IPs and redirect to the service that is exposed.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install miao\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1.Generate service discovery link:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar Miao = require('miao');\r\n\r\nvar opts = {\r\n  // See below\r\n};\r\n// Get URL\r\nvar url = Miao(opts);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.Distribute the generated url to other device (e.g. by scanning a QR code)\r\n\r\n3.Put `miao.png` to the web server's root.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\nField | Default | description\r\n----- | ------- | --------------\r\n`proxy` | `catx.me/miao` | Url to the proxy page\r\n`protocol` | `\"\"` | Protocol of exposed HTTP/HTTPs service\r\n`port` | `80` | Port of exposed service\r\n`path` | `/` | Path to be redirected\r\n`query` | `{}` | Queries to be passed to the service\r\n\r\n### Hosting your own proxy page\r\n\r\nJust clone this project and put to a web server that you see fit.\r\n","created":"2015-10-06T18:51:21.350Z","modified":"2015-10-06T18:51:21.350Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"akfish","email":"akfish@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"akfish","email":"akfish@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"miao","_nodeVersion":"0.12.1","_npmUser":{"name":"akfish","email":"akfish@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.7.3","_rev":"1-a256e1722985234d704d9da62fce823e","_shasum":"70bb062a9128b31ddca2098be874ccc44c112186","author":{"name":"AKFish","email":"akfish@gmail.com","url":"http://catx.me"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/akfish/miao/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"70bb062a9128b31ddca2098be874ccc44c112186","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/miao/-/miao-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"akfish","email":"akfish@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-10-06T18:51:21.350Z","created":"2015-10-06T18:51:21.350Z","1.0.0":"2015-10-06T18:51:21.350Z"}}}
