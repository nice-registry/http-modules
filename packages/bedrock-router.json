Bedrock router solves these issues.\n\n## Route patterns\n\nBedrock routes use a combination of [micromatch](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/micromatch) and [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html)-style pattern matching to enable maximum flexibility while remaining performant.\n\nValid routes:\n\n```\nGET /\nDELETE /path/to/:foo*\n?(PUT|POST) /some/:name\n```\n\n## Middleware\n\nThis has yet to be completed.\n\n## API\n\n```\nnew Router(options)\n```\n\nCurrently takes no options.\n\n### router.addRoute(pattern, callback) \n\nAdds a single route to the router.\n\n## As seen in\n\nBedrock is used in [the Comet platorm](http://github.com/comet-platform/comet-platform) and in a component of [GalacticJS](http://githb.com/GalacticJS).\n\n","created":"2016-07-20T05:41:34.696Z","modified":"2016-07-20T05:49:13.805Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"samvv","email":"sam@vervaeck.be"},"owners":[{"name":"samvv","email":"sam@vervaeck.be"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"bedrock-router","_nodeVersion":"5.12.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/bedrock-router-1.0.1.tgz_1468993752116_0.7357553262263536"},"_npmUser":{"name":"samvv","email":"sam@vervaeck.be"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"1-bd927e571f58dce1725e0c6cb4ae4b57","_shasum":"897789a872d748c2a884702df87a3d1abc9474a8","author":{"name":"Sam Vervaeck"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/samvv/manabi/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"897789a872d748c2a884702df87a3d1abc9474a8","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/bedrock-router/-/bedrock-router-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"samvv","email":"sam@vervaeck.be"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-07-20T05:49:13.805Z","created":"2016-07-20T05:41:34.696Z","1.0.0":"2016-07-20T05:41:34.696Z","1.0.1":"2016-07-20T05:49:13.805Z"}}}
