Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`\n2. Install homebridge-http using: `npm install -g homebridge-better-http-rgb`\n3. Update your configuration file.  See below for examples.\n\n\n# Configuration\n\n## Structure\n\nThe following is an overview of the structure of your HTTP-RGB accessory.\n\nBoth `powerOn` and `powerOff` can either be a `string` or an `object`.  If a\n`string` is provided it is filled in as the `url` and the `body` will be blank.\nMost devices will be ok with the `string` option.\n\nThe purpose of `powerOff`/`powerOn` for an RGB light is not to physically power\nor de-power the device (as then how would it respond to further commands?), but\nto set the LED color to black (for `powerOff`), and restore the color (for\n`powerOn`).  Your backend device should already be doing this.  This is just\na convenience function so that your HomeBridge knows this device can turn off\nor on.\n\nAdditionally, both `brightness` and `color` share the same structure (with the\nexception that the `color` structure allows for a `.brightness` variable), they\ncan either be a `string` or an `object`.  If it is a `string`, it is filled in\nas the `status` and the other fields are left blank. When this is the case, you\ncan only read the settings, you may not change them.\n\n\n    {\n        \"accessory\": \"HTTP-RGB\",\n        \"name\": string,\n\n        \"http_method\": string-optional,\n        \"username\": string-optional,\n        \"password\": string-optional,\n        \"sendImmediately\": string-optional,\n\n        \"switch\": {\n            \"status\": url-optional,\n            \"powerOn\": string-or-object,\n            \"powerOff\": {\n                url: string,\n                body: string\n            }\n        },\n\n        \"lock\": {\n            \"status\": url-optional,\n            \"secure\": string-or-object,\n            \"unsecure\": {\n                url: string,\n                body: string\n            }\n        },\n\n        \"brightness\": string-or-object,\n        \"color\": {\n            \"status\": url-status,\n            \"url\": url-optional,\n            \"brightness\": boolean,\n            \"http_method\": string-optional\n        }\n    }\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Full RGB Device\n\n    \"accessories\": [\n        {\n            \"accessory\": \"HTTP-RGB\",\n            \"name\": \"RGB Led Strip\",\n\n            \"switch\": {\n                \"status\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/status\",\n                \"powerOn\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/on\",\n                \"powerOff\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/off\"\n            },\n\n            \"brightness\": {\n                \"status\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/brightness\",\n                \"url\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/brightness/%s\"\n            },\n\n            \"color\": {\n                \"status\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/set\",\n                \"url\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/set/%s\",\n                \"brightness\": true\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n\n### Single Color Light that only turns \"off\" and \"on\"\n\n    \"accessories\": [\n        {\n            \"accessory\": \"HTTP-RGB\",\n            \"name\": \"Single Color Light\",\n\n            \"switch\": {\n                \"status\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/status\",\n                \"powerOn\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/on\",\n                \"powerOff\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/off\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n\n### Single Color Light with Brightness\n\n    \"accessories\": [\n        {\n            \"accessory\": \"HTTP-RGB\",\n            \"name\": \"Single Color Light\",\n\n            \"switch\": {\n                \"status\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/status\",\n                \"powerOn\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/on\",\n                \"powerOff\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/off\"\n            },\n\n            \"brightness\": {\n                \"status\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/brightness\",\n                \"url\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/brightness/%s\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n\n### RGB Light without Brightness\n\n    \"accessories\": [\n        {\n            \"accessory\": \"HTTP-RGB\",\n            \"name\": \"Single Color Light\",\n\n            \"switch\": {\n                \"status\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/status\",\n                \"powerOn\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/on\",\n                \"powerOff\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/off\"\n            },\n\n            \"color\": {\n                \"status\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/set\",\n                \"url\": \"http://localhost/api/v1/set/%s\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n\nThis normally will not occur, however, you may not want your application to\ndisplay a \"brightness\" slider to the user.  In this case, you will want to\nremove the brightness component from the config.\n\n\n# Interfacing\n\nAll the `.status` urls expect a 200 HTTP status code and a body of a single\nstring with no HTML markup.\n\n* `switch.status` expects `0` for Off, and `1` for On.\n* `brightness.status` expects a number from 0 to 100.\n* `color.status` expects a 6-digit hexidemial number.\n\n## http-led-controller\n\nThis package was developed in tandem with\n[jnovack/http-led-controller](https://github.com/jnovack/http-led-controller).\n\nI needed a way to control my [blinksticks](https://www.blinkstick.com/) from\nHomeKit/HomeBridge.  After developing this package, I had to have a backend in\nthe event someone's HomeKit/HomeBridge is on a different server, or in my case,\nthere are 4-5 different Raspberry Pi's running blinksticks around my house.\n\n\n# Why 'better'?\n\nAs we all know, the word 'better' is subjective, so why put it in the title? I\ndecided to call it 'better' because it is intended to be a 'better' example of\nhow to code, not in the way of a 'better' or more feature-rich project.\n\nThere's thousands of projects on github that are just thrown together, half-\nworking, or abandoned and I wanted to make sure that my little contribution to\nthe open-source movement gave more than just code.\n\nThe 'better'-project goals are to make sure there is documentation, tests, code\nand style standards. While I may have missed a few spots, my intention is to\nensure that those exist.  There is value in documentation, style and testing;\nand I want to serve as an example to younger (or newer) coders that may be\ntrying to hack apart this project.\n\n\n# TODO\n\n* Perhaps validation of some sort?\n* _httprequest should check for non-200\n* Better error handling of config errors","starsCount":3,"created":"2016-01-15T00:48:14.012Z","modified":"2017-01-22T17:28:58.939Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jnovack","email":"jnovack@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"jnovack","email":"jnovack@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"homebridge-better-http-rgb","_nodeVersion":"0.12.3","_npmUser":{"name":"jnovack","email":"jnovack@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.9.1","_rev":"2-6e917578049425f2b7798913564710b1","_shasum":"fcd121aae35757230eac4073556e3112a8ddde15","author":{"name":"Justin J.
