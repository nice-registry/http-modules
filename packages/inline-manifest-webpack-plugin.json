Cause webpack's runtime always change between every build, it's better to split the runtime code out for long-term caching.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\nInstall the plugin with npm:\n```shell\n$ npm i inline-manifest-webpack-plugin -D\n```\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nThis plugin need to work with [HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin) v2.10.0 and above:\n\n__Step1__: split out the runtime code\n```javascript\n// for explicit vendor chunk config\n[\n\tnew webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({\n\t\tnames: ['vendor', 'manifest']\n\t})\n]\n\n// or specify which chunk to split manually\n[\n\tnew webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({\n\t\tname: 'manifest',\n        chunks: ['...']\n\t})\n]\n```\n__Step2__: config HtmlWebpackPlugin:\n```javascript\n[\n\tnew HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n\t\ttemplate: './index.ejs'\n\t})\n]\n```\n\n__Step3__: config InlineManifestWebpackPlugin\n* __name__: default value is `webpackManifest`,  result in `htmlWebpackPlugin.files[name]`, you can specify any other name __except__ `manifest`, beacuse the name `manifest` haved been used by HtmlWebpackPlugin for H5 app cache manifest.\n```javascript\n[\n\tnew InlineManifestWebpackPlugin({\n\t\tname: 'webpackManifest'\n\t})\n]\n```\n\n```html\n<!-- index.ejs -->\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n\t<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n\t<title>App</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n\n<%=htmlWebpackPlugin.files.webpackManifest%>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n__Done!__\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2016-05-19T05:03:23.699Z","modified":"2017-06-01T05:59:08.054Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"szrenwei","email":"371151833@qq.com"},"owners":[{"name":"szrenwei","email":"371151833@qq.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"inline-manifest-webpack-plugin","_nodeVersion":"5.0.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/inline-manifest-webpack-plugin-3.0.1.tgz_1464170520369_0.9876794326119125"},"_npmUser":{"name":"szrenwei","email":"371151833@qq.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.3.6","_rev":"4-659e15eacb47d97474055e33442c2ca1","_shasum":"ca2151063115298e2fd94b669ab76c7dd63e44ad","author":{"name":"szrenwei","email":"shizairw@gmail.com","url":"https://github.com/szrenwei"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/szrenwei/inline-manifest-webpack-plugin/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"3.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"ca2151063115298e2fd94b669ab76c7dd63e44ad","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/inline-manifest-webpack-plugin/-/inline-manifest-webpack-plugin-3.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"szrenwei","email":"371151833@qq.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-01T05:59:08.054Z","created":"2016-05-19T05:03:23.699Z","1.0.0":"2016-05-19T05:03:23.699Z","1.1.0":"2016-05-21T14:10:56.976Z","2.0.0":"2016-05-21T14:47:37.747Z","2.1.0":"2016-05-24T05:58:54.583Z","3.0.0":"2016-05-25T06:19:01.327Z","3.0.1":"2016-05-25T10:02:00.840Z"},"users":{"fengmiaosen":true}}}
