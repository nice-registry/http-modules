SuperAgent [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/superagent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/superagent)\n\n[![Sauce Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/shtylman-superagent.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/shtylman-superagent)\n\nSuperAgent is a small progressive __client-side__ HTTP request library, and __Node.js__ module with the same API, sporting many high-level HTTP client features. View the [docs](http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/).\n\n![super agent](http://f.cl.ly/items/3d282n3A0h0Z0K2w0q2a/Screenshot.png)\n\n## Installation\n\nnode:\n\n```\n$ npm install superagent\n```\n\nWorks with [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) and should work with [webpack](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/wiki/SuperAgent-for-Webpack)\n\n```js\nrequest\n  .post('/api/pet')\n  .send({ name: 'Manny', species: 'cat' })\n  .set('X-API-Key', 'foobar')\n  .set('Accept', 'application/json')\n  .end(function(err, res){\n    // Calling the end function will send the request\n  });\n```\n\n## Supported browsers and Node versions\n\nTested browsers:\n\n- Latest Firefox, Chrome, Safari\n- Latest Android, iPhone\n- IE10 through latest. IE9 with polyfills.\n\nEven though IE9 is supported, a polyfill for `window.FormData` is required for `.field()`.\n\nNode 4 or later is required.\n\n# Plugins\n\nSuperAgent is easily extended via plugins.\n\n```js\nvar nocache = require('superagent-no-cache');\nvar request = require('superagent');\nvar prefix = require('superagent-prefix')('/static');\n\nrequest\n  .get('/some-url')\n  .query({ action: 'edit', city: 'London' }) // query string\n  .use(prefix) // Prefixes *only* this request\n  .use(nocache) // Prevents caching of *only* this request\n  .end(function(err, res){\n    // Do something\n  });\n```\n\nExisting plugins:\n * [superagent-no-cache](https://github.com/johntron/superagent-no-cache) - prevents caching by including Cache-Control header\n * [superagent-prefix](https://github.com/johntron/superagent-prefix) - prefixes absolute URLs (useful in test environment)\n * [superagent-suffix](https://github.com/timneutkens1/superagent-suffix) - suffix URLs with a given path\n * [superagent-mock](https://github.com/M6Web/superagent-mock) - simulate HTTP calls by returning data fixtures based on the requested URL\n * [superagent-mocker](https://github.com/shuvalov-anton/superagent-mocker) — simulate REST API\n * [superagent-cache](https://github.com/jpodwys/superagent-cache) - A global SuperAgent patch with built-in, flexible caching (compatible with SuperAgent `1.x`)\n  * [superagent-cache-plugin](https://github.com/jpodwys/superagent-cache-plugin) - A SuperAgent plugin with built-in, flexible caching (compatible with SuperAgent `1.x`)\n * [superagent-jsonapify](https://github.com/alex94puchades/superagent-jsonapify) - A lightweight [json-api](http://jsonapi.org/format/) client addon for superagent\n * [superagent-serializer](https://github.com/zzarcon/superagent-serializer) - Converts server payload into different cases\n * [superagent-use](https://github.com/koenpunt/superagent-use) - A client addon to apply plugins to all requests.\n * [superagent-httpbackend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent-httpbackend) - stub out requests using AngularJS' $httpBackend syntax\n * [superagent-throttle](https://github.com/leviwheatcroft/superagent-throttle) - queues and intelligently throttles requests\n * [superagent-charset](https://github.com/magicdawn/superagent-charset) - add charset support for node's SuperAgent\n\nPlease prefix your plugin with `superagent-*` so that it can easily be found by others.\n\nFor SuperAgent extensions such as couchdb and oauth visit the [wiki](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/wiki).\n\n## Running node tests\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```shell\n$ npm install\n```\nRun em!\n\n```shell\n$ make test\n```\n\n## Running browser tests\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```shell\n$ npm install\n```\n\nStart the test runner:\n\n```shell\n$ make test-browser-local\n```\n\nVisit `http://localhost:4000/__zuul` in your browser.\n\nEdit tests and refresh your browser. You do not have to restart the test runner.\n\n\n## Packaging Notes for Developers\n\n**npm (for node)** is configured via the `package.json` file and the `.npmignore` file. Key metadata in the `package.json` file is the `version` field which should be changed according to semantic versioning and have a 1-1 correspondence with git tags. So for example, if you were to `git show v1.5.0:package.json | grep version`, you should see `\"version\": \"1.5.0\",` and this should hold true for every release. This can be handled via the `npm version` command. Be aware that when publishing, npm will presume the version being published should also be tagged in npm as `latest`, which is OK for normal incremental releases. For betas and minor/patch releases to older versions, be sure to include `--tag` appropriately to avoid an older release getting tagged as `latest`.\n\n**npm (for browser standalone)** When we publish versions to npm, we run `make superagent.js` which generates the standalone `superagent.js` file via `browserify`, and this file is included in the package published to npm (but this file is never checked into the git repository). If users want to install via npm but serve a single `.js` file directly to the browser, the `node_modules/superagent/superagent.js` is a standalone browserified file ready to go for that purpose. It is not minified.\n\n**npm (for browserify)** is handled via the `package.json` `browser` field which allows users to install SuperAgent via npm, reference it from their browser code with `require('superagent')`, and then build their own application bundle via `browserify`, which will use `lib/client.js` as the SuperAgent entrypoint.\n\n**bower** is configured via the `bower.json` file. Bower installs files directly from git/github without any transformation, so you *must* use Browserify or Webpack (or use npm).\n\n##
