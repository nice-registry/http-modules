It changes responses from remote websites.\n\n\nUsing this, you can forget about having your local HTTP server or using `rsync`/`wget` to sync your computer with the remote site, broken URLs and ajax APIs, cross-domain problems, and just access the website you are changing and activate the `replace.js` or `fakeDir.js` plugins.\n\nYou can also access websites only accessible to your computer (E.G. in your local server and/or with a hostname only you have in `/etc/hosts`) from the outside, by accessing through your proxy.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone this repository\n\n        git clone git@github.com:fabiosantoscode/magicProxy.git\n\n2. Npm install the dependencies\n\n        npm install\n      \n3. Run the proxy\n\n        node index.js\n\n4. Access your system's network configuration, and set up your proxy to `localhost`, port `8080`\n\n\n## Included plug-ins.\n\n - replace.js: Intercepts requests for key files and responds with local files instead.\n - fakeDir.js: Pretend a local folder is actually on the server.\n - markup.js: Uses [cheerio](https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio) for changing HTML markup. You can insert or remove chunks.\n - empty.js: Empty some HTTP responses. Useful for annoying tracking scripts.\n - log.js: Log HTTP verbs, status codes and URLS for every response.\n\nConfiguration instructions are written in the plugins' `.js` files.\n\n\n## Usage examples:\n\n - Work on the JS code of a remote website on its true environment without tripping on cross-domain policy\n - Change the living, working HTML on a remote website without worrying about using relative URLs\n - Stop scripts which jam your debugger from loading\n - Remove some elements from remote sites you are working on, such as video players, canvases, etc.\n\n## Roadmap:\n\n - A plug-in interface with a unified configuration system\n - HTTPS support, WS support\n - A simple command line interface (execute on a folder, looks for .magicproxyrc configuration files and load them)\n - Run as a web application for showing others your local work\n - Split plugins into several projects\n - Verbose mode, which shows what requests were changed, and by which plugin\n - Automatic rebuild plugin, which watches directory for changes and executes a script when necessary\n\nBe happy!\n\n-- Fábio\n","versions":[{"number":"0.0.0","date":"2013-10-29T14:36:36.312Z"}],"created":"2013-10-29T14:36:33.486Z","modified":"2013-10-29T14:36:36.312Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"fabiosantoscode","email":"fabiosantosart@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"fabiosantoscode","email":"fabiosantosart@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"magicproxy","_npmUser":{"name":"fabiosantoscode","email":"fabiosantosart@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.2.32","_rev":"1-50d46a8d137e9947d9c739c9edbc1e88","author":{"name":"Fábio Santos [blog]","url":"http://fabiosantoscode.blogspot.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/fabiosantoscode/magicProxy/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"0fee320f0a0aac7b1e9bee0f06158dd58a68a17e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/magicproxy/-/magicproxy-0.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"fabiosantoscode","email":"fabiosantosart@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-10-29T14:36:36.312Z","created":"2013-10-29T14:36:33.486Z","0.0.0":"2013-10-29T14:36:36.312Z"}}}
