This is a temporary fix until [this npm issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10074) is solved.\n\n### `test`\n\nLint the source files and runs the specs.\nThis is executed during Travis CI builds.\n\n## Resources\n\nIf you just want to create a bot, take a look at https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder first.\n\nYou can find the decompiled source code of the Skype Web Application on [the `skype-web-reversed` repository](https://github.com/demurgos/skype-web-reversed).\n\n## What's not working and probably never will.\n* [Old P2P group chats](https://github.com/ShyykoSerhiy/skyweb/issues/6). According to  [Skype community site ](http://community.skype.com/t5/Skype-for-Web-Beta/Group-chats-missing-on-skype-web/td-p/3884218) only new, Cloud based group chats are shown in SkypeWeb Beta(therefore works in this API). The old P2P group chats are not.  \n\n## Disclaimer \nThis project relies on SkypeWeb Skype implementation. If Microsoft Corporation decides to remove Skype\nimplementation (or change it in any) skyweb might not be in working state. Therefore it's not recommended to use it \nin any critical part of production code. In fact it's not recommended to use it in production at all.\n\n[MIT License](https://github.com/demurgos/skype-http/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n","created":"2016-05-08T11:54:30.356Z","modified":"2017-05-10T20:37:28.095Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"demurgos","email":"demurgos@demurgos.net"},"owners":[{"name":"demurgos","email":"csamborski@hotmail.fr"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"skype-http","_nodeVersion":"7.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/skype-http-0.0.12.tgz_1494448647613_0.5610277843661606"},"_npmUser":{"name":"demurgos","email":"demurgos@demurgos.net"},"_npmVersion":"4.5.0","_rev":"3-96171aa4542cef6a7db345ad0abad288","_shasum":"8b1ee647ee64b8790b371c9bb2b0f8f01a10548c","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ocilo/skype-http/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.12"},"dist":{"shasum":"8b1ee647ee64b8790b371c9bb2b0f8f01a10548c","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/skype-http/-/skype-http-0.0.12.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"demurgos","email":"csamborski@hotmail.fr"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-10T20:37:28.095Z","created":"2016-05-08T11:54:30.356Z","0.0.4":"2016-05-08T11:54:30.356Z","0.0.5":"2016-05-16T12:30:03.829Z","0.0.6":"2016-05-16T14:07:20.944Z","0.0.7":"2016-05-22T10:45:18.755Z","0.0.8":"2016-05-24T09:05:09.198Z","0.0.9":"2016-05-24T21:06:21.363Z","0.0.10":"2016-05-24T22:21:13.058Z","0.0.11":"2017-05-09T18:49:25.221Z","0.0.12":"2017-05-10T20:37:28.095Z"}}}
