More features will be added, hopefully.\n\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/jafarovr/publishify/raw/master/screenshot.png \"Screenshot\")\n\n### How to install\n\nIn order to use this tool, **[node.js]**, **[npm]** and **[Git]** should be installed on your machine. Then you could just run following commands.\n```\n[sudo] npm install -g publishify\n```\n**Note**: You may need ``sudo`` access to install it.\n\n### Usage\n```\npublishify DIRECTORY\n```\n###### Example:\n```\npublishify /home/user\n```\n###### Output:\n```\npublishify running on directory /Users/rj\nopen http://192.168.1.90:3030/ on your browser to view your files.\n```\nThen, visit following link: ``http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT``. If you're running locally (you won't probably need it) visit ``http://localhost:PORT``.\n\nIf you want to expose your directory to the web and share it with your friends, just use following command.\n```\npublishify /home/user -e\n```\nYou will see an output given below. The functionality is powered by [localtunnel].\n```\npublishify running on directory .\nopen http://192.168.1.102:55676/ on your browser to view your files.\nyour directory is also publicly available on http://jrsqgsdpgq.localtunnel.me\n```\n\nTry running ``publishify --help`` to get more info about how to run it. There's not much stuff now, but will add more soon.\n\n### Tools used\n\n* [Express] - Node.js web application framework\n* [EJS] - Embedded JavaScript templating\n* [localtunnel] - Exposes your localhost to the world!\n\nand many more...\n\n### More?\n\nThe project is currently under development. More features will be added soon. Use it on your own risk! Feel free to contribute to the project and/or contact me for any suggestions/bugs.\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 [Ramin Jafarov].
