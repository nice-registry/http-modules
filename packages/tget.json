If more than one media file is available, tget will\nprovide a m3u playlist listing all media files found. Else, the default\nfile will be the biggest file from the torrent.\n\nWhile stream data has higher priority than non-stream data (such as\n.nfo or preview files), tget still download the entire torrent data\nwhen bandwidth allows it. When the `-w` option is given, tget will wait\nan incoming stream connection before dowloading any data from the torrent.\n\nWhen the `-w` option is given, `-e` and `-i` are implicitely enabled.\nThis turns tget into a streaming-only downloader and no data will be\nkept upon exit.\n\n## Local streaming\n\nThe stream engine from tget can also be used for streaming local files.\n\nWhen the `-S` option is given, tget will not attempt to download a\ntorrent but will instead use the given path as the stream data source.\nThis can be a single file as well as a directory.\n\n`tget ./local.mp4 -S`\n\nIf the `-S` option is given, no other option will be used.\n`-i` is implicitely enabled.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2014-04-22T01:31:52.027Z","modified":"2014-06-09T21:53:34.677Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"galedric","email":"g@ledric.me"},"owners":[{"name":"galedric","email":"g@ledric.me"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"tget","_npmUser":{"name":"galedric","email":"g@ledric.me"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.9","_rev":"1-491256ec1e3becf21fb6d8eaa02922bb","_shasum":"a8b6c884cdf98f69cba1045278cf3d0930e871c9","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/galedric/tget/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.9.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"a8b6c884cdf98f69cba1045278cf3d0930e871c9","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/tget/-/tget-0.9.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"galedric","email":"g@ledric.me"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-06-09T21:53:34.677Z","created":"2014-04-22T01:31:52.027Z","0.5.0":"2014-04-22T01:31:52.027Z","0.5.1":"2014-04-22T03:00:26.871Z","0.5.2":"2014-05-02T11:52:08.691Z","0.5.3":"2014-05-08T16:57:05.537Z","0.6.0":"2014-05-11T13:54:05.302Z","0.7.0":"2014-05-19T04:02:54.182Z","0.8.0":"2014-05-24T16:44:53.209Z","0.8.1":"2014-06-01T12:20:04.999Z","0.9.0":"2014-06-07T11:52:37.462Z","0.9.1":"2014-06-07T11:59:03.319Z","0.9.2":"2014-06-09T21:53:34.677Z"},"users":{"gmturbo":true}}}
