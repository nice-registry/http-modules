All of these methods share the same interface and\nimplementation. They only differ in setting the respective HTTP request method\nappropriately.\n\nThe options object is optional and is used to set request-promise options for\nthe request.\n\nThe session argument is an immutable-core session object.\n\n## request (options, session)\n\nThe request method is what Immutable HTTP Client uses internally to implement\nthe delete, get, post, and put methods.\n\nThe options for the request method are options for request-promise.\n\nIf the body option is an object and the `json` option is not set then the json\noption will be set to true so that the body is serialized as JSON for the\nrequest.\n\nThe `simple` option is always set to false so that HTTP errors will *not*\nresult in promise rejections.\n\nWith Immutable HTTP Client a rejection will only occur on a system level error\nnot on HTTP response code errors.\n\nIf the HTTP response has the content-type application/json header set and the\n`json` option is not explicitly set then the response will be parsed using\nJSON.parse. If the response is not valid JSON this will throw an exception.\n\nThe response that will be returned by all methods is a simple object that\nincludes the body (string|object), rawHeaders (array), and statusCode (integer).\n\n## Setting a log client\n\n    const http = require('immutable-http-client')\n\n    http.logClient(logClient)\n\nThe logClient sets the logging client which will be used to log all http\nrequests and responses.","created":"2016-11-20T01:16:41.524Z","modified":"2017-06-17T18:22:34.057Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ersun.warncke","email":"ersun.warncke@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"ersun.warncke","email":"ersun.warncke@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"immutable-http-client","_nodeVersion":"7.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/immutable-http-client-0.6.1.tgz_1497723753096_0.5103227600920945"},"_npmUser":{"name":"ersun.warncke","email":"ersun.warncke@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.2.0","_rev":"34-b11807af2c5842c11b5e875929cdd361","_shasum":"7ebbd0e10d99df6f2d5bb9561a30a1b8638157d3","author":{"name":"Ersun Warncke","email":"ersun.warncke@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/warncke/immutable-http-client/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.6.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"7ebbd0e10d99df6f2d5bb9561a30a1b8638157d3","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/immutable-http-client/-/immutable-http-client-0.6.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ersun.warncke","email":"ersun.warncke@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-17T18:22:34.057Z","created":"2016-11-20T01:16:41.524Z","0.1.0":"2016-11-20T01:16:41.524Z","0.2.0":"2016-11-24T13:47:55.051Z","0.3.0":"2016-11-24T15:13:57.696Z","0.3.1":"2017-02-11T15:38:43.198Z","0.4.0":"2017-02-22T15:01:14.052Z","0.4.6":"2017-03-25T23:56:29.725Z","0.4.7":"2017-03-25T23:57:58.708Z","0.4.8":"2017-03-26T00:00:28.876Z","0.4.9":"2017-03-26T00:07:27.780Z","0.4.10":"2017-03-26T01:13:13.489Z","0.4.11":"2017-03-26T03:35:32.599Z","0.4.12":"2017-03-26T03:40:46.161Z","0.4.13":"2017-03-29T01:59:33.202Z","0.4.14":"2017-04-12T06:30:34.401Z","0.4.15":"2017-04-26T17:27:33.129Z","0.4.16":"2017-04-26T18:47:05.771Z","0.4.17":"2017-05-10T15:56:30.305Z","0.4.18":"2017-05-19T14:33:15.264Z","0.4.19":"2017-05-19T15:50:53.700Z","0.4.20":"2017-05-25T16:07:39.888Z","0.4.21":"2017-05-25T17:19:54.143Z","0.5.0":"2017-05-30T03:29:15.626Z","0.5.1":"2017-06-02T05:27:53.512Z","0.5.2":"2017-06-02T05:44:47.574Z","0.5.3":"2017-06-05T08:53:09.403Z","0.5.4":"2017-06-05T11:05:52.296Z","0.5.5":"2017-06-05T11:11:06.194Z","0.5.6":"2017-06-06T22:51:33.233Z","0.5.7":"2017-06-06T22:53:59.637Z","0.5.8":"2017-06-07T03:33:05.387Z","0.5.9":"2017-06-07T03:45:41.089Z","0.5.10":"2017-06-07T03:48:15.420Z","0.6.0":"2017-06-10T06:25:47.678Z","0.6.1":"2017-06-17T18:22:34.057Z"}}}
