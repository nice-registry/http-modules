Update your configuration file.

Specify the `status_url` in your config.json that returns the status of the device as an integer (0 = off, 1 = on). Specify the `brightnesslvl_url` to return the current brighness level as an integer.\n\nSwitch handling and brightness handling support 3 methods, yes for polling on app load, realtime for constant polling or no polling\n\nConfiguration sample:\n\n ```\n\"accessories\": [ \n\t{\n\t\t\"accessory\": \"Http\",\n\t\t\"name\": \"Alfresco Lamp\",\n\t\t\"switchHandling\": \"realtime\",\n\t\t\"http_method\": \"GET\",\n\t\t\"on_url\":      \"http://localhost/controller/1700/ON\",\n\t\t\"off_url\":     \"http://localhost/controller/1700/OFF\",\n\t\t\"status_url\":  \"http://localhost/status/100059\",\n\t\t\"service\": \"Light\",\n\t\t\"brightnessHandling\": \"yes\",\n\t\t\"brightness_url\":     \"http://localhost/controller/1707/%b\",\n\t\t\"brightnesslvl_url\":  \"http://localhost/status/100054\",\n\t\t\"sendimmediately\": \"\",\n\t\t\"username\" : \"\",\n\t\t\"password\" : \"\"\t\t\t\t\t    \n       } \n    ]","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2016-02-09T01:19:29.737Z"},{"number":"1.0.0","date":"2016-02-09T05:03:41.050Z"},{"number":"1.0.1","date":"2016-02-09T05:14:21.153Z"},{"number":"1.0.2","date":"2016-02-09T05:21:45.543Z"},{"number":"1.1.0","date":"2016-02-09T05:34:23.770Z"},{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2016-02-09T05:53:43.802Z"},{"number":"0.1.1","date":"2016-02-09T05:58:02.258Z"},{"number":"0.1.2","date":"2016-02-09T06:15:56.466Z"},{"number":"0.1.3","date":"2016-02-09T06:30:53.883Z"},{"number":"0.1.4","date":"2016-02-09T06:40:51.254Z"},{"number":"0.1.5","date":"2016-02-09T06:45:08.775Z"},{"number":"0.1.6","date":"2016-02-09T07:06:39.047Z"},{"number":"0.1.7","date":"2016-02-09T07:12:53.300Z"},{"number":"0.1.8","date":"2016-02-09T07:17:07.400Z"},{"number":"0.1.9","date":"2016-02-09T07:18:44.899Z"},{"number":"0.1.10","date":"2016-02-09T07:22:22.692Z"},{"number":"0.1.11","date":"2016-02-09T07:26:32.787Z"},{"number":"0.1.12","date":"2016-02-09T07:34:19.783Z"},{"number":"0.1.13","date":"2016-02-09T08:38:52.187Z"},{"number":"0.1.14","date":"2016-02-09T08:49:52.471Z"},{"number":"0.1.15","date":"2016-02-09T08:57:33.487Z"},{"number":"0.1.16","date":"2016-02-10T11:02:24.396Z"},{"number":"0.1.17","date":"2016-02-18T20:07:45.312Z"},{"number":"0.1.18","date":"2016-02-19T00:20:06.840Z"},{"number":"0.1.19","date":"2016-02-19T08:41:49.137Z"}],"created":"2016-02-09T01:19:29.737Z","modified":"2016-02-19T08:41:49.137Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tannebil","email":"btanner54@pobox.com"},"owners":[{"name":"tannebil","email":"btanner54@pobox.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"homebridge-http-haikuhelper","_nodeVersion":"5.5.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-6-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/homebridge-http-haikuhelper-0.1.19.tgz_1455871306672_0.07233049906790257"},"_npmUser":{"name":"tannebil","email":"btanner54@pobox.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.7.1","_rev":"1-f3dea84530d4fb0523868d587952a438","_shasum":"6972c58e39242a05c4d09ccc0cbba62260e2fa03","author":{"name":"tannebil"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tannebil/homebridge-http-advanced/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Adrian Rudman"},{"name":"David Parry"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.19"},"dist":{"shasum":"6972c58e39242a05c4d09ccc0cbba62260e2fa03","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/homebridge-http-haikuhelper/-/homebridge-http-haikuhelper-0.1.19.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tannebil","email":"btanner54@pobox.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-02-19T08:41:49.137Z","created":"2016-02-09T01:19:29.737Z","0.0.1":"2016-02-09T01:19:29.737Z","1.0.0":"2016-02-09T05:03:41.050Z","1.0.1":"2016-02-09T05:14:21.153Z","1.0.2":"2016-02-09T05:21:45.543Z","1.1.0":"2016-02-09T05:34:23.770Z","0.1.0":"2016-02-09T05:53:43.802Z","0.1.1":"2016-02-09T05:58:02.258Z","0.1.2":"2016-02-09T06:15:56.466Z","0.1.3":"2016-02-09T06:30:53.883Z","0.1.4":"2016-02-09T06:40:51.254Z","0.1.5":"2016-02-09T06:45:08.775Z","0.1.6":"2016-02-09T07:06:39.047Z","0.1.7":"2016-02-09T07:12:53.300Z","0.1.8":"2016-02-09T07:17:07.400Z","0.1.9":"2016-02-09T07:18:44.899Z","0.1.10":"2016-02-09T07:22:22.692Z","0.1.11":"2016-02-09T07:26:32.787Z","0.1.12":"2016-02-09T07:34:19.783Z","0.1.13":"2016-02-09T08:38:52.187Z","0.1.14":"2016-02-09T08:49:52.471Z","0.1.15":"2016-02-09T08:57:33.487Z","0.1.16":"2016-02-10T11:02:24.396Z","0.1.17":"2016-02-18T20:07:45.312Z","0.1.18":"2016-02-19T00:20:06.840Z","0.1.19":"2016-02-19T08:41:49.137Z"}}}
