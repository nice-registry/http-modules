helper functions for working with the Node http module\n\nI wrote these because:\n\n1. Writing code that uses the Node built-in http module directly is a bit tedious\n2. I was repulsed by the size and complexity of popular modules like [request] (https://github.com/request/request)\n\nThis module is not trying to compete with [request] (https://github.com/request/request) - it only provides a few very simple functions to help reduce boilerplate when using the http module.\nSome of the functions are a bit specific to the Apigee permissions serviceâ€”the module should probably be split.","created":"2016-08-09T19:39:57.946Z","modified":"2017-06-07T01:56:20.270Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mpnally","email":"mpnally@yahoo.com"},"owners":[{"name":"jlin21","email":"jordanlin94@gmail.com"},{"name":"mpnally","email":"mpnally@yahoo.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"http-helper-functions","_nodeVersion":"6.10.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/http-helper-functions-0.0.109.tgz_1496800580097_0.13971139094792306"},"_npmUser":{"name":"mpnally","email":"mpnally@yahoo.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.1","_rev":"69-03decadc8a7577d26cdd7912d08841f0","author":{"name":"Martin
