If this is not needed then the first parameter can be left empty.\n\n\n```\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar soap = require('soap');\nvar X509HttpClient = require('soap-x509-http');\n\n\nvar myX509Client = new X509HttpClient({\n  pfx: fs.readFileSync('<your-client-certificate.pfx>'),\n  passphrase: '<password>',\n  ca: fs.readFileSync('<ca-certificate.pem>'),\n  rejectUnauthorized: false\n}, {\n  key: fs.readFileSync('<your-client-key.pem>')\n});\n\n\nvar wsdl = './WebService.wsdl';\nvar args = {name: 'value'};\n\nsoap.createClient(wsdl, {\n  httpClient: myX509Client\n},\nfunction(err, client) {\n  client.setEndpoint('<webservice-endpoint>');\n\n  client.MyFunction(args, function(err, result) {\n    console.log(result);\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n## More info\nFor more references and examples on how to use **node-soap**, please check:\n\n- [node-soap](https://github.com/vpulim/node-soap) - A SOAP client and server for node.js.\n- [ws.js](https://github.com/yaronn/ws.js) - A WS-* client stack for node.js.
