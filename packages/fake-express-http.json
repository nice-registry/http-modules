Supports Express 4, requires Node 4.x or newer.\n\nSupports asynchronous functions by returning a promise from `response.onEnd()`.\n\nIncludes fake and real tests using same controllers to ensure fake is accurate.\n\nWhat is a Fake?\n---------------\n\nThe real thing is substituted by a fake.  Where as mocks only partially substitute aspects of the real thing.\n\nFakes ahear to [Liskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle).\n\nState of the Art\n----------------\n\nThe existence of this library is justified, as state of the art libraries are deficient.\n\n* [node-mocks-http](https://github.com/howardabrams/node-mocks-http) (AKA express-mocks-http)\n    * Does not support Express 4.\n* [mock-express-request](https://github.com/lykmapipo/mock-express-request) + [mock-express-response](https://github.com/lykmapipo/mock-express-response)\n    * Unit testing requires both a fake request and response.  Should be a single library.\n    * [Node.js Stream API](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) callback style events are exposed to allow for asynchronous testing.\n    * As a result does not support promises and has a leaky abstraction with a Stream API `finish` event.\n","created":"2016-02-16T09:18:41.590Z","modified":"2017-03-10T21:36:44.355Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"pyrolistical","email":"pyrogx1133@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"pyrolistical","email":"pyrogx1133@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"fake-express-http","_nodeVersion":"7.7.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/fake-express-http-1.3.0.tgz_1489181804103_0.22309010359458625"},"_npmUser":{"name":"pyrolistical","email":"pyrogx1133@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.1.2","_rev":"2-f4dccb87cc01da1a7deb74f00baf26a6","_shasum":"a2ad8a11592229121478efa08d01469f07dacf64","author":{"name":"Ronald Chen"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/concept-not-found/fake-express-http/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.3.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"a2ad8a11592229121478efa08d01469f07dacf64","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/fake-express-http/-/fake-express-http-1.3.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"pyrolistical","email":"pyrogx1133@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-10T21:36:44.355Z","created":"2016-02-16T09:18:41.590Z","1.0.0":"2016-02-16T09:18:41.590Z","1.1.0":"2016-05-30T19:02:14.765Z","1.2.0":"2016-07-27T21:37:00.582Z","1.3.0":"2017-03-10T21:36:44.355Z"}}}
