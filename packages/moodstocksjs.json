There is no error handling at all and for many of the functions there is no way to know if it was successful or not (other than checking to see if the image was added, removed etc).\n\n## Release History\n\n* 0.0.1 Initial release\n* 0.0.2 Updated the NPM package\n* 0.0.3 Added a callback to the 'add' function so you can find out whether the image was added.\n* 0.0.4 Fixed a bug where the callback wasn't being called.","created":"2015-01-06T12:39:27.903Z","modified":"2015-01-07T00:49:55.773Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jmacmullin","email":"jake@stripysock.com.au"},"owners":[{"name":"jmacmullin","email":"jake@stripysock.com.au"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"moodstocksjs","_npmUser":{"name":"jmacmullin","email":"jake@stripysock.com.au"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.3","_rev":"1-b0827c140ff9a41dff4d0f69919a6946","author":{"name":"Jake MacMullin","email":"jake@stripysock.com.au","url":"http://stripysock.com.au/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jmacmullin/moodstocksjs/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"2ea0b050ac28f1d55b2a78f47d28ad01bc7001ea","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/moodstocksjs/-/moodstocksjs-0.0.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jmacmullin","email":"jake@stripysock.com.au"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-01-07T00:49:55.773Z","created":"2015-01-06T12:39:27.903Z","0.0.2":"2015-01-06T12:39:27.903Z","0.0.3":"2015-01-06T23:09:00.087Z","0.0.4":"2015-01-07T00:49:55.773Z"}}}
