Internally if passed a string curli will use `url.parse()` to create an object that gets passed to `http.request(opts)`.\n\nYou may also wish to specify custom headers to be sent with the request. These can be passed via the optional `opts` argument. This is optional as it's also possible to pass headers via `uri.headers` where `uri` is a `http.request(opts)` style object.\n\nThe third argument is a standard Node style callback `cb(err, headers)` and will be called once a response is recieved. It returns `err` as an error object or `null`, and `headers` is a standard JavaScript object identical to `res.headers` object.\n\n# Install\n\n`npm install curli`\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2014-02-24T11:00:48.723Z","modified":"2017-05-22T14:38:14.073Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"joshgillies","email":"npm@joshgilli.es"},"owners":[{"email":"npm@josh.gl","name":"joshgillies"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"curli","_nodeVersion":"0.10.33","_npmUser":{"name":"joshgillies","email":"npm@joshgilli.es"},"_npmVersion":"2.1.11","_rev":"2-a63b16b604d355655f4d5d47a15a3faf","_shasum":"a5de11337e51ea8902b0bdd5f623fdac90717e8f","author":{"name":"Josh Gillies","email":"npm@joshgilli.es","url":"http://joshgilli.es/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/joshgillies/node-curli/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"a5de11337e51ea8902b0bdd5f623fdac90717e8f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/curli/-/curli-0.5.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"npm@josh.gl","name":"joshgillies"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-22T14:38:14.073Z","created":"2014-02-24T11:00:48.723Z","0.0.1":"2014-02-24T11:00:48.723Z","0.1.0":"2014-08-14T03:42:40.858Z","0.1.1":"2014-08-14T03:48:04.985Z","0.2.0":"2014-08-14T09:15:35.722Z","0.3.0":"2014-08-18T11:01:50.636Z","0.4.0":"2014-08-20T10:01:32.172Z","0.5.0":"2014-12-09T08:00:56.686Z"},"users":{"joshgillies":true}}}
