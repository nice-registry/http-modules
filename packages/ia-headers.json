You can use a module like [bhttp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bhttp) to interact with the API. The documentation for the Internet Archive S3 API can be found [here](https://archive.org/help/abouts3.txt). API keys can be obtained [here](http://archive.org/account/s3.php).\n\n`ia-header` supports multiple values for a metadata field - simply pass them in as an array (see also the Usage example below). Underscores are translated into double dashes, as per the IA S3 documentation.\n\n## License\n\n[WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/) or [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), whichever you prefer. A donation and/or attribution are appreciated, but not required.\n\n## Donate\n\nMy income consists entirely of donations for my projects. If this module is useful to you, consider [making a donation](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/donate.html)!\n\nYou can donate using Bitcoin, PayPal, Gratipay, Flattr, cash-in-mail, SEPA transfers, and pretty much anything else.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests welcome. Please make sure your modifications are in line with the overall code style, and ensure that you're editing the `.coffee` files, not the `.js` files.\n\nBuild tool of choice is `gulp`; simply run `gulp` while developing, and it will watch for changes.\n\nBe aware that by making a pull request, you agree to release your modifications under the licenses stated above.\n\n## Caveats\n\n* Metadata keys (not values!) may only be ASCII. The Internet Archive does not currently support non-ASCII metadata keys.\n* All non-ASCII and non-printable characters in metadata values are URL-encoded - this could cause potentially significant header size increases. In most cases, this won't matter.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar iaHeaders = require(\"ia-headers\");\n\nvar metadata = {\n\tsubject: [\"mirror\", \"pdf.yt\"],\n\tmediatype: \"texts\",\n\tcollection: \"pdfymirrors\",\n\tdate: \"2014-03-01\",\n\ttitle: \"Some Document (PDFy mirror)\",\n\tdescription: \"This is a document from PDFy.<br>It's a mirror.\"\n}\n\nvar metadataHeaders = iaHeaders(metadata);\nconsole.log(metadataHeaders);\n\n/* Result:\n{ 'x-archive-meta1-subject': 'mirror',\n  'x-archive-meta2-subject': 'pdf.yt',\n  'x-archive-meta-mediatype': 'texts',\n  'x-archive-meta-collection': 'pdfymirrors',\n  'x-archive-meta-date': '2014-03-01',\n  'x-archive-meta-title': 'Some Document (PDFy mirror)',\n  'x-archive-meta-description': 'This is a document from PDFy.<br>It\\'s a mirror.' }\n*/\n```\n","created":"2015-04-09T20:16:59.463Z","modified":"2015-04-09T20:16:59.463Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"joepie91","email":"admin@cryto.net"},"owners":[{"name":"joepie91","email":"admin@cryto.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ia-headers","_nodeVersion":"0.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"joepie91","email":"admin@cryto.net"},"_npmVersion":"2.1.3","_rev":"1-ca5796adeadba13267da9384ecfb681a","_shasum":"df52a020a7d7a7b20cfe94692a65ce41052b4864","author":{"name":"Sven Slootweg"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/joepie91/node-ia-headers/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"df52a020a7d7a7b20cfe94692a65ce41052b4864","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ia-headers/-/ia-headers-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"joepie91","email":"admin@cryto.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-04-09T20:16:59.463Z","created":"2015-04-09T20:16:59.463Z","1.0.0":"2015-04-09T20:16:59.463Z"}}}
