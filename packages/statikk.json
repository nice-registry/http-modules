Your `.git` files are not exposed. (Whereas ALL other simple http servers do expose this security concern)\n1. The server isn't accessible outside of `localhost`. Other folks on your network won't be able to browse it via your internal IP.\n\n## Command line usage\n\n```bash\n$ yarn global add statikk\n$ cd ~/Sites/fidgetspin.xyz\n$ statikk\n```\n\nThen head to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the\ncontents of `./` served over HTTP.\n\n\n### Command line options\n\n* **hidden**: allow transfer of hidden files. Defaults to false\n* **expose**: expose server to hosts other than `localhost`. Defaults to false\n* **port**: custom port. Defaults to 8080\n\n### Examples\n\n```bash\n// Start server at http://localhost:9000 serving ./\n$ statikk --port 9000\n\n// Start server at http://localhost:8080 serving ~/Sites/project\n$ statikk --port 8080 ~/Sites/project\n```\n\n### History\n\nThis project is a fork of...\n\n* https://github.com/boardman/statik which is a fork of\n* https://github.com/johnkelly/statik which is a fork of\n* https://github.com/hongymagic/statik (the OG `statik` on NPM) which hasn't been updated for 4 years.\n\nThe original project doesn't correct exclude all hidden files, which is why I've forked and republished.  ~paul irish. june 2017.\n","created":"2017-06-21T23:54:14.405Z","modified":"2017-06-22T00:14:30.097Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"paulirish","email":"paul.irish@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"paulirish","email":"paul.irish@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"statikk","_nodeVersion":"7.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/statikk-1.0.3.tgz_1498090469979_0.25636646477505565"},"_npmUser":{"name":"paulirish","email":"paul.irish@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.2.0","_rev":"4-5c223cd1455a9a19affa1f2539097230","_shasum":"2c6418589cbb1b3199d19695c729b6cc7da52a17","author":{"name":"David Hong","email":"davidhong.code@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/paulirish/statikk/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"2c6418589cbb1b3199d19695c729b6cc7da52a17","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/statikk/-/statikk-1.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"paulirish","email":"paul.irish@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-22T00:14:30.097Z","created":"2017-06-21T23:54:14.405Z","1.0.0":"2017-06-21T23:54:14.405Z","1.0.1":"2017-06-22T00:00:56.995Z","1.0.2":"2017-06-22T00:04:42.126Z","1.0.3":"2017-06-22T00:14:30.097Z"}}}
