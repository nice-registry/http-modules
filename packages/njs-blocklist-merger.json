Unfortunately, there are scenarios in which the desired IP ranges come from separated sources on the Internet, and some programs only allow for one source url to update their IP ranges.\r\n\r\nnjs-blocklist-merger is an HTTP server that can download multiple IP range files in p2p format (see http://sourceforge.net/p/peerguardian/wiki/dev-blocklist-format-p2p/) from the web simultaneously and merge them on demand. It is meant to be run locally (eg. on http://localhost:1337/) so that programs requiring a unique IP blocklist can query it to download IP ranges from many sources.\r\n\r\nSets of blocklist sources are arranged in text files and placed in a local folder. Then, njs-blocklist-merger will serve a merged version of all the blocklists in a given file when requested.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n------------\r\n\r\nnjs-blocklist-merger is a NodeJS script that setups an HTTP server listening on a configured port number and wait for GET requests in the form http://host:port/listname. Then it looks for a file named _listname_ in local folder _./lists/_. Each file in this folder must be encoded in UTF-8 and contains a list of urls specifying where to download the blocklists to merge. Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored by njs-blocklist-merger. After such file is parsed, njs-blocklist-merger downloads specified blocklists in parallel. Each downloaded blocklist must be in p2p format, encoded in UTF-8 and served either in plain text or gzip format. When all requested data is available, njs-blocklist-merger merges them and responds to the HTTP request with a blocklist in p2p format encoded in UTF-8 and served in plain text with MIME type text/plain.\r\n\r\nKown bugs and limitations\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n* Exceptions need to be handled in some parts of the code to keep the server live through some kinds of failures like problems accessing local list files, etc.\r\n* HTTP redirections are handled when downloading blocklists from the Internet, but the server is not protected from looping redirections (will probably cause a stack overflow).\r\n* Blocklist files are downloaded in parallel but the server waits for each request to complete before it merges the content and responds.\r\n* When the HTTP server responds, it does not provide the Content-Length header field so client programs will not be able to display progress as they download the merged blocklist from it.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. Install NodeJS on your system (see http://nodejs.org/).\r\n2. Install NPM on your system (see https://npmjs.org/).\r\n3. Place _server.js_ in the folder of your choice.\r\n4. Use NPM to install the _async_ module, either locally in the same folder as _server.js_, or globally (see https://github.com/caolan/async).\r\n5. Create a folder alongside _server.js_ named _lists_.\r\n6. Place list files inside the _lists_ folder in the format specified above.\r\n7. Run the server by executing the command:\r\n\r\n````````\r\nnode /path/to/folder/server.js host=localhost port=1337\r\n````````\r\n\r\nYou can customize the host and port numbers.\r\n\r\nThen, any program can then request http://localhost:1337/mylist to download a merged version of the blocklists specified in file _mylist_.\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nnjs-blocklist-merger is written in TypeScript (see http://www.typescriptlang.org/). You need it installed (eg. as a NodeJS module) to be able to compile server.ts.\r\n\r\nYou can compile njs-blocklist-merger with the following command line:\r\n````\r\ntsc --sourcemap --target ES5 server.ts\r\n````\r\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2013-01-28T07:42:57.557Z"},{"number":"0.1.1","date":"2013-01-30T07:58:17.978Z"},{"number":"0.1.2","date":"2013-01-30T16:11:55.631Z"},{"number":"0.1.3","date":"2013-01-30T16:19:34.566Z"},{"number":"0.1.4","date":"2013-01-30T16:32:32.266Z"}],"created":"2013-01-28T07:42:54.182Z","modified":"2013-01-30T16:32:32.266Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"spellizzari","email":"sebastien.pellizzari+npm@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"spellizzari","email":"sebastien.pellizzari+npm@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"njs-blocklist-merger","_npmUser":{"name":"spellizzari","email":"sebastien.pellizzari+npm@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.66","_rev":"1-a03290e7eef1821a3b7480f315dc9158","author":{"name":"Sebastien Pellizzari"},"bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/spellizzari/njs-blocklist-merger/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"165271483fe83b5242d2c02c8e26189a2ae0db20","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/njs-blocklist-merger/-/njs-blocklist-merger-0.1.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"spellizzari","email":"sebastien.pellizzari+npm@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-01-30T16:32:32.266Z","created":"2013-01-28T07:42:54.182Z","0.1.0":"2013-01-28T07:42:57.557Z","0.1.1":"2013-01-30T07:58:17.978Z","0.1.2":"2013-01-30T16:11:55.631Z","0.1.3":"2013-01-30T16:19:34.566Z","0.1.4":"2013-01-30T16:32:32.266Z"}}}
