Apache caches\nresources. Apache requires configuration. Do you really need to be running\nMySQL to develop a JavaScript game?\n\nUsing Python's SimpleHTTPServer causes its own headaches: it's slow, it can\nquickly get overwhelmed by requests and start randomly 404ing.\n\nSince the game you're writing is in JavaScript, why not run a server written in\nJavaScript?\n\nHence this project.\n\n**Do not use this server in production**. It exposes Weltmeister and is\nnot written with an eye towards anything resembling security.\nSeriously, just don't.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall via `npm`. If you don't have `npm` yet:\n\n     curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh\n\nOnce you have `npm`:\n\n     npm install impact-dev-server -g\n\nThis will install `impact-dev-server` globally so that it may be run from the\ncommand line.\n\n## Usage:\n\n     impact-dev-server [-p port] [-r] [path]\n\n`[path]` defaults to `./`. Optional.\n`-p port` defaults to 8080. Optional.\n`-r` will start a live-reload server. The page will automatically reload when\nyou change your game's files. Defaults to no live reload. Optional. See section\nbelow for some caveats.\n\n## Live Reload\n\nVery handy for quick edit-and-test cycle when messing around with entities. This\noption *will not* reload when levels are saved in Weltmeister, however. You'll\nhave to do that yourself.\n\n## Contributors!\n\n* Thanks to [pixelpicosean][] for the live reload feature.\n\n[impactjs]: http://impactjs.com\n[pixelpicosean]: https://github.com/pixelpicosean\n","created":"2013-03-09T07:02:32.325Z","modified":"2014-12-18T15:52:44.946Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"drhayes","email":"drhayes@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"drhayes","email":"drhayes@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"impact-dev-server","_npmUser":{"name":"drhayes","email":"drhayes@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.3","_rev":"1-a93fd01a9408948250e61af04a8b7cf7","author":{"name":"David Hayes","email":"drhayes@gmail.com","url":"http://drhayes.io"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/drhayes/impact-dev-server/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Sean Bohan","url":"https://github.com/pixelpicosean"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"53cc5b4eeea94e3a459a245505bf144c1e36b6f5","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/impact-dev-server/-/impact-dev-server-0.3.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"drhayes","email":"drhayes@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-12-18T15:52:44.946Z","created":"2013-03-09T07:02:32.325Z","0.1.0":"2013-03-09T07:02:35.353Z","0.1.1":"2013-03-30T04:18:42.930Z","0.1.2":"2013-04-03T14:35:55.246Z","0.2.0":"2013-11-20T03:56:25.414Z","0.2.1":"2014-09-23T21:23:02.677Z","0.3.0":"2014-12-18T15:52:44.946Z"}}}
