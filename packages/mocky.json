http mocking server with simple config written on nodejs\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/2do2go/mocky.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/2do2go/mocky)\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install mocky\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nCreate new mock.js file with content\n\n```js\nvar mocky = require('mocky');\n\nmocky.createServer([{\n// simple GET route without request body to match\n\turl: '/someurl1?a=b&c=d',\n\tmethod: 'get',\n\tres: 'response for GET request'\n}, {\n// POST route with request body to match and respose with status, headers and body\n\turl: '/someurl2?a=b&c=d',\n\tmethod: 'post',\n\treq: 'POST request body to match',\n\tres: {\n\t\tstatus: 202,\n\t\theaders: {'Content-type': 'text/html'},\n\t\tbody: '<div>response to return to client</div>'\n\t}\n}, {\n// PUT route with dynamic response body\n\turl: '/someurl3?a=b&c=d',\n\tmethod: 'put',\n\treq: 'PUT request body to match',\n\tres: function(req, res) {\n\t\treturn 'PUT response body';\n\t}\n}, {\n// GET route with regexp url and async response with status, headers and body\n\turl: /\\/someurl4\\?a=\\d+/,\n\tmethod: 'get',\n\tres: function(req, res, callback) {\n\t\tsetTimeout(function() {\n\t\t\tcallback(null, {\n\t\t\t\tstatus: 202,\n\t\t\t\theaders: {'Content-type': 'text/plain'},\n\t\t\t\tbody: 'async response body'\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t}, 1000);\n\t}\n}]).listen(4321);\n\n```\n\nThat's all now you can run mock server `node mock.js`, after\nthat if you send `GET` request to `http://127.0.0.1:4321/someurl1?a=b&c=d` and\nget `response for GET request` to the client, send `POST` request to\n`http://127.0.0.1:4321/someurl?a=b&c=d` with body `POST request body to match`\n... and so on, just try it.\n\n## Requests recording\n\nIt's very handy to auto record requests, do it somewhere at start of your main\napp file\n\n```js\nmocky.recorder.start({print: true});\n```\n\nAfter that all http/https requests will be logged into console immediately after\nexecution.\n\nYou also can manually control `recorder` - `start` recorder then after some\nrequests occures you can manually process recorder `outputs` e.g.\n\n```js\nconsole.log(mocky.recorder.outputs)\n```\n\nYou also can `stop` recorder and `clear` outputs.\n\n```js\nmocky.recorder.stop();\nmocky.recorder.clean();\n```\n\n## Running test\n\nInto cloned repository run\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\n## TODO\n* improve server logging\n* support request headers matching\n","created":"2013-03-16T08:20:46.567Z","modified":"2017-01-11T12:58:01.153Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"2do2go","email":"dev.2do2go@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"2do2go","email":"dev.2do2go@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"mocky","_nodeVersion":"4.4.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/mocky-0.1.11.tgz_1484139456207_0.4014007947407663"},"_npmUser":{"name":"2do2go","email":"dev.2do2go@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.15.3","_rev":"4-b333507634fbb5fc8cb8c3b62237908c","_shasum":"7d534ae5346a3e321cf0f71ba39398ae54f427a7","author":{"name":"2do2go team","email":"dev.2do2go@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/2do2go/mocky/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.11"},"dist":{"shasum":"7d534ae5346a3e321cf0f71ba39398ae54f427a7","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/mocky/-/mocky-0.1.11.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"2do2go","email":"dev.2do2go@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-11T12:58:01.153Z","created":"2013-03-16T08:20:46.567Z","0.1.0":"2013-03-16T08:20:49.322Z","0.1.1":"2013-03-16T08:48:00.549Z","0.1.2":"2013-04-02T09:01:41.861Z","0.1.3":"2013-04-02T10:38:59.551Z","0.1.4":"2013-04-02T19:46:59.194Z","0.1.5":"2013-04-03T08:22:23.539Z","0.1.6":"2013-04-09T20:27:10.527Z","0.1.7":"2013-10-23T08:24:23.141Z","0.1.8":"2014-02-03T13:00:06.700Z","0.1.9":"2014-02-03T13:03:47.433Z","0.1.10":"2016-06-26T08:15:58.086Z","0.1.11":"2017-01-11T12:57:36.816Z"}}}
