However, the\ninternal nodeJS app can tell if the original request was made with\nHTTP by inspecting headers inserted by Heroku.  We can use this\nto redirect to the HTTPS Heroku url.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n```\nnpm install force-ssl-heroku --save\n```\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nIt's designed for use with [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express):\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\nvar forceSsl = require('force-ssl-heroku');\n\nvar app = express();\napp.use(forceSsl);\n\n// Example:\napp.get('/ping', pingHandler); // I'll now redirect to HTTPS.\n\n// ... configure the rest of your routes.\n\napp.listen(3000, 'localhost');\n```\n\nCaveat\n======\n\nIt works because Heroku exposes your app through a reverse proxy which is used for load-balancing and other things.  This reverse proxy does SSL termination and forwards to your app which __should only accept connections from localhost__.  The middleware detects this situation by inspecting headers inserted by Heroku's reverse proxy;  __since headers can be spoofed, you should not use this middleware anywhere that's not behind such a proxy__!\n","created":"2016-01-25T23:38:33.790Z","modified":"2016-01-25T23:38:33.790Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"pauohp","email":"tarallo.php@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"pauohp","email":"tarallo.php@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"force-ssl-heroku-eb","_nodeVersion":"5.4.1","_npmUser":{"name":"pauohp","email":"tarallo.php@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.3.12","_rev":"1-a0f77337827e316124be4398659aeec7","_shasum":"b6b0c7f37f5026f7ad43b2a92eead9c96f43ba29","author":{"name":"Seth Davenport"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/paulohp/force-ssl-heroku/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"b6b0c7f37f5026f7ad43b2a92eead9c96f43ba29","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/force-ssl-heroku-eb/-/force-ssl-heroku-eb-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"pauohp","email":"tarallo.php@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-01-25T23:38:33.790Z","created":"2016-01-25T23:38:33.790Z","1.0.0":"2016-01-25T23:38:33.790Z"}}}
