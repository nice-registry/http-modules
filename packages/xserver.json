The point is to deliever files and respond to regular expression routing.\n\nBasics of the Server:\n\n1. When a request is sent to the server it matches the URI pattern to any routes you have set up to run. It is up to the routed method to return a response. \n2. If no routes are found it will try to find a file and return it. \n3. If no files are found it will return a 404 status response code.\n\n## Installation\n```\nnpm install xserver\n```\n\n## Example\n```\nvar XServer = require(\"./xserver.js\");\n\nvar xs = new XServer({\n  directories: [\"./public\"],\n  temporaryDirectory: \"./tmp\",\n  port: 3003\n});\n\nxs.get(/^$/, function ( directive ) {\n\tdirective.sendText(\"XServer\");\n});\n\nxs.get(/^coffee$/, function ( directive ) {\n  directive.setData(\"Hello World!\");\n  directive.next();\n});\n\nxs.get(/^chain$/, \nfunction ( directive ) {\n\tdirective.setData(\"Chain 1\");\n\tdirective.next();\n},\nfunction ( directive ) {\n\tdirective.setData(directive.data + \"\\nChain 2\");\n\tdirective.setContentType(\"txt\");\n\tdirective.next();\n});\n\nxs.get(/^download-file$/, function ( directive ) {\n  directive.perpareFile(\"./package.json\", function ( err ) {\n    if ( err ) return directive.sendStatus(500);\n    directive.send();\n  });\n});\n\nxs.get(/^say\\/(.*)$/, function ( directive, segment ) {\n  directive.sendText(\"Server says: \" + segment);\n});\n\nxs.start();\n```\n","created":"2014-01-31T19:32:19.671Z","modified":"2014-09-01T16:03:22.448Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tmathews","email":"thomas.c.mathews@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"tmathews","email":"thomas.c.mathews@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"xserver","_npmUser":{"name":"tmathews","email":"thomas.c.mathews@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.23","_rev":"1-4f8ef32d051b0a9cb4afd6dc537f39b6","_shasum":"d0b02d727e27483da3a81cdd966a1e7d501c07c3","author":{"name":"Thomas Mathews","email":"thomas.c.mathews@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tmathews/xserver/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"3.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"d0b02d727e27483da3a81cdd966a1e7d501c07c3","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/xserver/-/xserver-3.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tmathews","email":"thomas.c.mathews@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"Readme.md","time":{"modified":"2014-09-01T16:03:22.448Z","created":"2014-01-31T19:32:19.671Z","0.0.1":"2014-01-31T19:32:20.694Z","0.0.2":"2014-02-11T01:11:45.398Z","0.0.3":"2014-02-11T01:25:53.279Z","0.0.4":"2014-03-03T00:55:23.920Z","0.1.0":"2014-03-30T22:04:49.626Z","0.1.1":"2014-03-30T23:29:25.176Z","0.1.2":"2014-04-05T23:38:11.569Z","1.0.0":"2014-07-05T18:46:02.770Z","1.0.1":"2014-07-05T18:51:03.712Z","1.0.2":"2014-08-03T22:30:57.998Z","1.0.3":"2014-08-03T22:53:44.223Z","1.1.0":"2014-08-04T01:31:45.688Z","1.1.1":"2014-08-04T14:47:54.647Z","1.2.1":"2014-08-04T15:28:57.221Z","2.0.0":"2014-08-04T15:51:44.988Z","2.0.1":"2014-08-04T17:11:34.677Z","3.0.0":"2014-08-04T20:43:11.594Z","3.0.1":"2014-09-01T16:00:55.486Z","3.0.2":"2014-09-01T16:03:22.448Z"}}}
