The error classes are created using the <a href=\"https://github.com/One-com/node-createerror\">createError module</a>.\n\nThe original use case for `httpErrors` is to use a custom <a href=\"https://github.com/visionmedia/express\">express</a> error handler that uses the `statusCode` property of the error instance as the status code for the response, and optionally logs further info from the error.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nMake sure you have node.js and npm installed, then run:\n\n    npm install httperrors\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    var httpErrors = require('httperrors');\n\n    // Instatiate by status code:\n    var myError = httpErrors(412);\n\n    // Instantiate by name (UpperCamelCase):\n    var err = new httpErrors.NotFound('The thing you were looking for was not found');\n\n    console.warn(err.toString()); // NotFound [404]: The thing you were looking for was not found\n\n    if (identityCrisis) {\n        throw new httpErrors.ImATeapot('Dude...');\n    }\n\nThe CamelCased error name is exposed as a true property on the\ninstances, so your error handling code becomes quite readable (and you\ncan avoid using instanceof):\n\n    if (err.NotFound) {\n        // ...\n    } else if (err.BadGateway) {\n        // ...\n    }\n\nYou can also create an error by status code (useful when proxying):\n\n    function fetchSomething(cb) {\n        var request = require('request');\n        request('http://example.com/thething', function (err, response) {\n            if (err) {\n                return cb(new (httpErrors[response.statusCode] || httpErrors.BadGateway)());\n            }\n            // ...\n        });\n    }\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n3-clause BSD license -- see the `LICENSE` file for details.\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2012-02-23T16:58:41.939Z","modified":"2017-05-22T17:20:13.882Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"papandreou","email":"andreas@one.com"},"owners":[{"email":"andreas@one.com","name":"papandreou"},{"email":"ath@one.com","name":"ath"},{"email":"mail@mwinter.nl","name":"maartenwinter"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"httperrors","_nodeVersion":"6.3.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/httperrors-2.2.0.tgz_1493649121987_0.41481787874363363"},"_npmUser":{"name":"papandreou","email":"andreas@one.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.3","_rev":"3-ef29fbc8820788c65f20647504ff79eb","_shasum":"cdc2e21b8866a63f9ed69e569d075ea62a0c934f","author":{"name":"Andreas Lind Petersen","email":"andreas@one.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/One-com/node-httperrors/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"cdc2e21b8866a63f9ed69e569d075ea62a0c934f","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/httperrors/-/httperrors-2.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"andreas@one.com","name":"papandreou"},{"email":"ath@one.com","name":"ath"},{"email":"mail@mwinter.nl","name":"maartenwinter"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-22T17:20:13.882Z","created":"2012-02-23T16:58:41.939Z","0.0.1":"2012-02-23T16:58:43.231Z","0.1.0":"2012-06-15T06:49:40.145Z","0.1.1":"2012-08-27T20:29:03.193Z","0.2.0":"2012-09-01T21:12:46.591Z","0.3.0":"2013-06-03T14:51:04.901Z","0.4.0":"2013-09-06T21:46:11.434Z","0.4.1":"2014-04-15T12:23:07.006Z","0.5.0":"2014-07-24T23:39:05.118Z","0.6.0":"2014-09-09T10:59:04.329Z","0.6.1":"2014-09-09T10:59:55.078Z","0.7.0":"2014-09-22T09:16:58.676Z","0.7.1":"2014-12-01T16:16:38.332Z","1.0.0":"2015-07-21T14:14:46.523Z","1.1.0":"2015-07-22T13:46:28.024Z","1.2.0":"2016-01-06T12:48:52.374Z","2.0.0":"2016-02-21T20:06:40.712Z","2.0.1":"2016-02-21T20:43:51.250Z","2.1.0":"2016-04-08T06:45:37.651Z","2.2.0":"2017-05-01T14:32:03.725Z"},"users":{"focusaurus":true,"santihbc":true}}}
