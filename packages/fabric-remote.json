It allows you to remotely call\nFabric commands over the HTTP REST API provided by Fabric Remote.  It works both\nas a node module (server-site) and in the browser, thanks to browserify.\n\n# What is Fabric Remote?\n\nIt's a project I'm working on that I haven't open sourced yet.  But this is the JS interface for it!\n\n# Installation\n\nFor the browser:\n```\nbower install fabric-remote\n```\n\nFor node:\n```\nnpm install fabric-remote\n```\n\n\n# Usage\n\nFabric Remote Js provides the `FabricRemote` object.  This needs to be configured to point to the correct Fabric Remote server, and given the authorization credentials:\n\n```javascript\nvar fr = new FabricRemote(\"http://localhost\", 1234, \"opensesame\");\n```\n\nNow you can get a list of available tasks:\n\n```javascript\nfr.listTasks();\n```\n\nThis returns a promise that will return a result like this:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  host_type: {\n  name: \"host_type\",\n  description: \"returns the host type\"\n},\n  check_foo: {\n  name: \"check_foo\",\n  description: null\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere is how you execute tasks.  This allows you to pass args and kwargs, and you can also pass a list of tasks.\n\n```javascript\nfr.execute([\n  {task: \"host_type\", args: [\"foo\", \"bar\"], kwargs: {\"arg1\":\"val1\"}}\n])\n```\n\n# Promise interface\n\nYou can call .progress() on the promise to get regular updates of the streaming output of the task execution.  .success() will get called with the output of your execution.\n\n# TODO\n\nError handling sucks.\n","created":"2014-04-06T23:32:21.925Z","modified":"2014-08-08T23:18:45.730Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"kevin1024","email":"me@kevinmccarthy.org"},"owners":[{"name":"kevin1024","email":"me@kevinmccarthy.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"fabric-remote","_npmUser":{"name":"kevin1024","email":"me@kevinmccarthy.org"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.23","_rev":"1-92579aae87c6315026b1eccb367ded5e","_shasum":"5f22f80623e4b92c1e6fa475e692b4dfd53f3f6c","author":{"name":"Kevin McCarthy","email":"me@kevinmccarthy.org"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kevin1024/fabric-remote-js/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"5f22f80623e4b92c1e6fa475e692b4dfd53f3f6c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/fabric-remote/-/fabric-remote-0.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"kevin1024","email":"me@kevinmccarthy.org"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-08-08T23:18:45.730Z","created":"2014-04-06T23:32:21.925Z","0.0.1":"2014-04-06T23:32:21.925Z","0.0.2":"2014-04-06T23:41:15.618Z","0.1.0":"2014-04-12T09:10:57.901Z","0.1.1":"2014-04-17T06:21:08.256Z","0.2.0":"2014-08-08T23:18:45.730Z"}}}
