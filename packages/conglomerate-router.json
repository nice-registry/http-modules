Supports all modern\nbrowsers, tested on IE 9+, Chrome 16+, FireFox 5+, Safari 6+, Opera 12+.\n\n## Path matching order\n\nThe router iterates through the routing table and executes the first (and only\nthe first) matching route. Route matching is done based on the combination of\nthe request path and the HTTP verb (e.g. 'GET, 'POST'). The query is excluded\nfrom the routing logic. Requests are matched in a deterministic order where the\norder in which routes are added does not matter.\n\nRoutes are matched based on the specificity of the route which is evaluated at\neach segment of the path. Each path is split into its segment (the parts\nseparated by `'/'`).  The segments are compared to the routing table one at a\ntime and are matched against the most specific path until a match is found. If\nno match is found, the next match is tried.\n\nWhen matching routes, string literals (no path parameter) have the highest\npriority, followed by mixed parameters (`'/a{p}b'`), parameters (`'/{p}'`), and\nthen wildcard (`/{p*}`).\n\nNote that mixed parameters are slower to compare as they cannot be hashed and\nrequire an array iteration over all the regular expressions representing the\nvarious mixed parameter at each routing table node.\n\n## Catch all route\n\nIf the application needs to override the default Not Found (404) error\nresponse, it can add a catch-all route `{method: '*', path: '/{p*}'}` for a\nspecific method or all methods. Only one catch-all route can be defined per\nrouter.\n\n# [Thanks](https://github.com/eitherlands/conglomerate-router#Thanks)\n\nThanks to [Eran Hammer](@hueniverse) and @hapijs community for the quality\nengineering behind hapi.\n\nThanks to [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com) for providing the infrastructure\nthat allows us to run our build in real browsers.\n\n# [License](https://github.com/eitherlands/conglomerate-router#License)\n\nconglomerate-router is released under the terms of the BSD-3-Clause license.\n\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/conglomerate-router\n\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/conglomerate-router.svg\n\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/eitherlands/conglomerate-router\n\n[travis-image]: https://img.shields.io/travis/eitherlands/conglomerate-router.svg\n","created":"2016-03-19T13:39:29.522Z","modified":"2016-11-07T15:41:32.839Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"epiloque","email":"robots+npm@epiloque.com"},"owners":[{"name":"eitherlands","email":"robots+eitherlands@epiloque.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"conglomerate-router","_nodeVersion":"5.6.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/conglomerate-router-1.1.2.tgz_1459126453775_0.8957481530960649"},"_npmUser":{"name":"epiloque","email":"robots+npm@epiloque.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.6.0","_rev":"3-96648eebc4c922cee8ced08f7b017012","_shasum":"2592cb9fd28e37fe216e453a1e5b36849bbaa753","author":{"name":"Mark Milstein","email":"mark@eitherlands.com","url":"https://github.com/epiloque"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/eitherlands/conglomerate-router/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"2592cb9fd28e37fe216e453a1e5b36849bbaa753","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/conglomerate-router/-/conglomerate-router-1.1.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"eitherlands","email":"robots+eitherlands@epiloque.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-11-07T15:41:32.839Z","created":"2016-03-19T13:39:29.522Z","1.1.0":"2016-03-19T13:39:29.522Z","1.1.1":"2016-03-19T13:40:18.756Z","1.1.2":"2016-03-28T00:54:14.725Z"}}}
