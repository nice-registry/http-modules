So \n[Moojs](https://github.com/weflex/moojs) is a series of modules to compute \nthe latest backwards version for a Github-based repository.\n\n[Moojs](https://github.com/weflex/moojs) supports the following components:\n\n+ a command-line tool: `moo` to get started with how moojs works for your \n  LoopBack apps.\n+ a service app to integrate with your Github repository's webhooks.\n\n## Requirements\n\n+ To run the service and CLI, we recommend using io.js 2.5.0\n+ To enable to use moojs service on your public/private repository, you need:\n  - moojs is based on git's `refs/tags`, so you have to use tags and \n    semantic version as tag name.\n  - moojs needs the ability to comment, label and push status for your repository,\n    so you have to set the environment variable `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` when you\n    start the service.\n  - [Moojs](https://github.com/weflex/moojs) needs a field `backwards` in your \n    `package.json`.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n$ npm install moojs -g\n```\n\n### Deployment on [Heroku](https://herokuapp.com)\n\nBecause of builtin `Procfile` in this project, so you could easily by connecting one\nfork of this project to deploy [Moojs](https://github.com/weflex/moojs) on \n[Heroku](https://herokuapp.com).\n\nOf course you could deploy on your own machine, the startup script is:\n\n```sh\n$ npm start\n```\n\n### Webhooks Setup\n\nYou have to setup webhook mannually for now, the steps are below shown:\n\n+ click `settings` on the right bar of your repository.\n+ click `Webhooks & services`.\n+ click `Add webhook`.\n+ type your deployed moojs like `https://your-moojs-server/hook/github/push` at\n  \"Payload Url\" input.\n+ make sure \"Content type\" should be \"application/json\".\n+ jump to \"Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?\".\n+ select the last one, then you will get a list of events.\n+ check the \"Pull Request\" box only\n+ click the green button \"Add webhook\" to submit.\n+ working\n\n### How does [Moojs](https://github.com/weflex/moojs) work?\n\nWhen you successfully deployed moojs and added webhook to your repository, you would\nsee the following 2 things in your PRs:\n\n+ if the current `backwards` value is not equal to the computed value, the service would\n  comment on this discussion with some descriptive text to tell the condition.\n+ if the current `backwards` value is not equal to the computed value, the service would\n  add the `compatible` label under this issue/pr. Otherwise, once any commit get this\n  `backwards` be equal to the expected value, the `compatible` label would also be \n  removed.\n\n## License\n\nMPL-2.0 Licensed\n","created":"2015-09-22T14:06:23.377Z","modified":"2015-09-25T10:58:12.459Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"yorkie","email":"yorkiefixer@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"yorkie","email":"yorkiefixer@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"moojs","_nodeVersion":"2.5.0","_npmUser":{"name":"yorkie","email":"yorkiefixer@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.13.2","_rev":"1-d382d6e73d4e599293244b1c50cabf84","_shasum":"a7285cca077b120acd500de672826b36f8a2c07c","author":{"name":"Yorkie Liu","email":"yorkiefixer@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/weflex/moojs/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.5.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"a7285cca077b120acd500de672826b36f8a2c07c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/moojs/-/moojs-1.5.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"yorkie","email":"yorkiefixer@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-09-25T10:58:12.459Z","created":"2015-09-22T14:06:23.377Z","1.0.0":"2015-09-22T14:06:23.377Z","1.1.0":"2015-09-23T09:10:22.917Z","1.1.1":"2015-09-23T10:04:50.077Z","1.1.2":"2015-09-23T10:14:26.321Z","1.2.0":"2015-09-24T10:39:25.965Z","1.2.1":"2015-09-24T10:51:54.889Z","1.2.2":"2015-09-24T10:58:34.121Z","1.2.3":"2015-09-25T05:59:05.610Z","1.3.0":"2015-09-25T06:33:41.574Z","1.3.1":"2015-09-25T06:38:38.942Z","1.3.2":"2015-09-25T06:53:08.986Z","1.4.0":"2015-09-25T08:33:27.962Z","1.4.1":"2015-09-25T08:40:30.886Z","1.4.2":"2015-09-25T08:45:20.426Z","1.4.3":"2015-09-25T10:54:13.107Z","1.5.0":"2015-09-25T10:58:12.459Z"}}}
