For example:\n    `vlc.request('/requests/status.json?command=pl_pause')` – toggles a pause.\n    [list of HTTP requests and interface description](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_HTTP_requests/)\n  - `callback` – a function with error and status object as an arguments\n- `player.process` - exposed [spawned process](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options)\n- `player.quit()` – stops the movie and close the player (via `SIGKILL`)\n\n## Contribution\n\nPlease feel free to submit a pull request for a bug fix or new features\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2017-05-28T14:35:53.335Z","modified":"2017-06-23T10:49:09.226Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"valiafetisov","email":"valiafetisov@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"valiafetisov","email":"valiafetisov@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"vlc-simple-player","_nodeVersion":"6.2.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/vlc-simple-player-0.5.0.tgz_1496355368277_0.4249611720442772"},"_npmUser":{"name":"valiafetisov","email":"valiafetisov@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.9.3","_rev":"8-4607bc6d19d8de16c55f3f313676a1ae","_shasum":"a06134ad4a752fc41de215f840d582411006e294","author":{"name":"valia fetisov"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/valiafetisov/vlc-simple-player/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"a06134ad4a752fc41de215f840d582411006e294","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/vlc-simple-player/-/vlc-simple-player-0.5.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"valiafetisov","email":"valiafetisov@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-23T10:49:09.226Z","created":"2017-05-28T14:35:53.335Z","0.1.0":"2017-05-28T14:35:53.335Z","0.1.1":"2017-05-28T14:40:28.316Z","0.2.0":"2017-05-28T15:22:22.501Z","0.2.1":"2017-05-28T15:34:20.532Z","0.3.0":"2017-05-31T01:34:06.498Z","0.4.0":"2017-06-01T20:39:47.679Z","0.5.0":"2017-06-01T22:16:10.380Z"},"users":{"valiafetisov":true}}}
