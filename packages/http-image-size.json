When\nthe dimensions are present, the request is aborted.\n\n## Usage\n```js\nvar size = require('http-image-size');\n\nsize('http://die-tf.de/fuck-yeah/fuck-yeah.jpg', function(err, dimensions, length) {\n  console.log(err, dimensions, length);\n});\n```\n\nThe callback receives three arguments: `err`, `dimensions`, `length`:\n\n`dimensions` is in the form `{ height: 1063, width: 1600 }`.  \n`length` is the number of bytes loaded.\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2014 Johannes J.
