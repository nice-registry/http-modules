No user data is exposed, as it is the consumer that has access to the protected resource.\n\nIt works as https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-http-oauth but skips the access_token verification step and accepts empty access_tokens.\n\nThe cose base is 98% https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-http-oauth but adapted for the 2-legged scenario. So thanks jaredhanson for all work!.\n\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.8","date":"2013-06-06T21:08:19.900Z"}],"starsCount":0,"created":"2013-06-06T21:08:19.403Z","modified":"2013-06-06T21:08:19.900Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"bzwheeler","email":"bzwheeler@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"bzwheeler","email":"bzwheeler@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"passport-oauth-2-legged","_npmUser":{"name":"bzwheeler","email":"bzwheeler@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.2.11","_rev":"1-69c0980b12aa9fbb8cf9ec5030dcb9b6","author":{"name":"Camilo Tapia","email":"camilo.tapia@gmail.com","url":"http://www.onezerozeroone.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"git@github.com:bzwheeler/passport-http-2legged-oauth.git/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.8"},"dist":{"shasum":"2624e6986200c82a03c66316fae022065207c9e4","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/passport-oauth-2-legged/-/passport-oauth-2-legged-0.1.8.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"bzwheeler","email":"bzwheeler@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2013-06-06T21:08:19.900Z","created":"2013-06-06T21:08:19.403Z","0.1.8":"2013-06-06T21:08:19.900Z"},"users":{}}}
