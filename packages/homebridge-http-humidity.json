Install homebridge using: npm install -g homebridge\n2. Install this plugin using: npm install -g homebridge-http-humidity\n3. Update your configuration file. See sample-config.json in this repository for a sample.\n\n# Configuration\n\n\nConfiguration sample file:\n\n ```\n\"accessories\": [\n        \"accessories\": [\n        {\n            \"accessory\": \"HttpHumidity\",\n            \"name\": \"Outside Humidity\",\n            \"url\": \"http://192.168.1.210/humidity?format=json\",\n            \"http_method\": \"GET\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n```\n\n\nThe defined endpoint will return a json looking like this\n```\n{\n\t\"humidity\": 38\n}\n```\n\n\nThis plugin acts as an interface between a web endpoint and homebridge only. You will still need some dedicated hardware to expose the web endpoints with the relative humidity information. In my case, I used an Arduino board with Wifi capabilities.\n","created":"2016-07-12T20:48:01.660Z","modified":"2017-01-10T20:59:28.146Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"metbosch","email":"metbosch@outlook.com"},"owners":[{"name":"metbosch","email":"metbosch@outlook.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"homebridge-http-humidity","_nodeVersion":"5.11.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/homebridge-http-humidity-0.1.0.tgz_1484081966221_0.6277781124226749"},"_npmUser":{"name":"metbosch","email":"metbosch@outlook.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"2-0a52b70c11044b75ad3c4a8ba81b6142","_shasum":"73215871286cb84273e1e08ea90d953e4e7046ff","author":{"name":"@metbosch"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/metbosch/homebridge-http-humidity/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"73215871286cb84273e1e08ea90d953e4e7046ff","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/homebridge-http-humidity/-/homebridge-http-humidity-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"metbosch","email":"metbosch@outlook.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-10T20:59:28.146Z","created":"2016-07-12T20:48:01.660Z","0.0.1":"2016-07-12T20:48:01.660Z","0.0.2":"2016-07-27T16:44:24.144Z","0.1.0":"2017-01-10T20:59:28.146Z"}}}
