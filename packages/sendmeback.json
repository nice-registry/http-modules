A client sends a parameterised HTTP request to the server, specifying\nwhat it wants to see in the response.\n\nThe tool is designed to allow simple testing of intermediate network components such as firewalls and proxies.\n\n## Usage\n\nIn a browser, or using *curl*, visit the `/sendmeback/` route with an arbitary URL. *Sendmeback* will respond with an HTTP\nresponse with the response code equal to the first number it finds on the URL.\n\n*Sendmeback* will take all parameters passed to the URL and use them as HTTP headers in the response.\n\n### Example:\n```\n$ curl -v http://localhost:8080/sendmeback/201/test?Content-Type=text%2fcsv\\&Pragma=custom\n* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache\n*   Trying ::1...\n* connect to ::1 port 8080 failed: Connection refused\n*   Trying 127.0.0.1...\n* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)\n> GET /sendmeback/201/test?Content-Type=text%2fcsv&Pragma=custom HTTP/1.1\n> User-Agent: curl/7.37.1\n> Host: localhost:8080\n> Accept: */*\n>\n< HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n< X-Powered-By: Express\n< Content-Type: text/csv; charset=utf-8\n< Pragma: custom\n< Date: Tue, 24 Mar 2015 14:04:06 GMT\n< Connection: keep-alive\n< Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n<\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\n201:/sendmeback/201/test?Content-Type=text%2fcsv&Pragma=custom\n ```\n\n## Installation\n\n*Sendmeback* requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Install node, and then install *sendmeback*:\n```\nnpm install sendmeback\n```\n\nYou can then start *sendmeback* either with:\n```\nnode app.js\n```\nor\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\n## Homepage\n\nYou can find details of *sendmeback* at the project homepage: [https://github.com/hossg/sendmeback](https://github.com/hossg/sendmeback)\n\n","created":"2015-03-24T11:28:23.857Z","modified":"2015-04-08T20:19:06.436Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"hossg","email":"hossein.ghodse@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"hossg","email":"hossein.ghodse@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"sendmeback","_nodeVersion":"0.12.1","_npmUser":{"name":"hossg","email":"hossein.ghodse@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.5.1","_rev":"1-fe2d3cca4e56b56e089f963ca0459847","_shasum":"7253341ccc7dd112c83f258749ee68b463cfb634","author":{"name":"hossg"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hossg/sendmeback/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"7253341ccc7dd112c83f258749ee68b463cfb634","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/sendmeback/-/sendmeback-0.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"hossg","email":"hossein.ghodse@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-04-08T20:19:06.436Z","created":"2015-03-24T11:28:23.857Z","0.0.1":"2015-03-24T11:28:23.857Z","0.0.2":"2015-03-24T11:34:51.038Z","0.0.3":"2015-03-24T11:39:04.448Z","0.0.4":"2015-03-24T11:43:49.378Z","0.1.0":"2015-03-24T14:08:21.589Z","0.1.1":"2015-03-24T16:36:08.741Z","0.2.0":"2015-04-08T20:19:06.436Z"}}}
