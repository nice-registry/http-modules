Useful for RESTful APIs.\n\n## How to use\n\n```javascript\nvar basicAuth = require('connect-basic-auth');\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express.createServer();\napp.use(basicAuth(function(credentials, req, res, next) {\n  /**\n   * Credentials has the following structure: \n   * {\n   *   username: 'c4milo'\n   *   password: 'lepassword'\n   * }\n   **/\n  Account.authenticate(credentials, function(error) {\n    next(error);\n  });\n\n\n}, 'Please enter your credentials.'));\n\n//Routes that do not require authentication go first\napp.post('/accounts', function(req, res, next) {\n  //Creates an Account.\n});\n\n//Lets require authentication for the rest of our routes.\napp.all('*', function(req, res, next) {\n  req.requireAuthorization(req, res, next);\n});\n\napp.get('/accounts/:username', function(req, res, next) {\n  //Returns :username account information\n});\n\n```\n\n## License\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright 2012 Camilo Aguilar.
