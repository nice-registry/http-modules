To learn more about Typescene, head over to the main [Typescene repository](https://www.github.com/typescene/typescene).\r\n\r\n## Purpose of this module\r\nThe `typescene-async-http` library is *not*, and will never be, a full framework for web application client-server communication.\r\n\r\nHowever, since most applications won't need much more than simple \"Ajax\"-style REST requests to transfer HTML or JSON data anyway---and there are no simple ways to achieve this in a cross-browser solution using Promises, this library at least provides the basics.\r\n\r\nFor its implementation of Promises and Signals (for intercepting requests and responses), this module relies on the [`typescene-async`](http://github.com/typescene/typescene-async) module.\r\n\r\n## Exported members\r\nThe `typescene-async-http` module exports the following classes and methods:\r\n\r\n* `fetch` function --- mimics the `window.fetch` function in modern browsers. Internally uses either XMLHttpRequest or the native fetch implementation to process requests and responses, and always returns a Promise for a response object.\r\n* `getTextAsync` and `getBlobAsync` --- to perform a GET request and return a Promise for the text or blob response data.\r\n* `getHtmlContentAsync` --- to perform a GET request and return a Promise for a document fragment that contains everything in the HTML response's `<body>`.\r\n* `getAsync`, `postAsync`, `putAsync`, and `deleteAsync` --- wrapper functions that send JSON data and return a promise for a parsed JSON response.\r\n* `MockResponse` and `MockResponseHeaders` --- can be used to generate mock responses, and used internally to transform XMLHttpRequest data.\r\n* `Requesting` and `Responded` signals --- for intercepting requests and responses.\r\n* `options` object --- contains options for default behavior of the `fetch` function.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [samples](http://typescene.github.io/typescene-async-http/#/samples) for common usage patterns.\r\n","created":"2017-01-08T06:31:29.753Z","modified":"2017-03-20T16:56:07.197Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"typescene","email":"jcormont+typescene@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"typescene","email":"jcormont+typescene@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"typescene-async-http","_nodeVersion":"6.2.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/typescene-async-http-0.1.1.tgz_1484104843726_0.6163555202074349"},"_npmUser":{"name":"typescene","email":"jcormont+typescene@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.9","_rev":"3-ceba3e211ba37e6d80fd94d7b42b8d10","_shasum":"05e1a626367e1469be9d497836d5c9e15140666d","author":{"name":"Jelmer Cormont"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/typescene/typescene-async-http/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"05e1a626367e1469be9d497836d5c9e15140666d","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/typescene-async-http/-/typescene-async-http-0.1.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"typescene","email":"jcormont+typescene@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-20T16:56:07.197Z","created":"2017-01-08T06:31:29.753Z","0.1.0":"2017-01-08T06:31:29.753Z","0.1.1":"2017-01-11T03:20:45.433Z"}}}
