On CLI mode, it takes three commandline arguments. All options are\noptional, the defaults work fine in many cases.\n\n#### Module\nLeave options that you do not want to change undefined:\n\n```var u = require('utuber'),\n\to = {p: [PORT], P: [HOMEPATH], a: [ALLOWEDCHARACTERS]};\nu.start(o);```\n\n* Define p to change server bind port\n* Define P to change download destination (defaults to current directory)\n* Define a to change the regular expression to parse title to filename (allowed characters regexp)\n\n#### CLI\nSame options as above, with CLI arguments:\n* -p\n* -P\n* -a\n\n### Client\nChange `uTuberServer` variable at the beginning of the bookmark to point to your server.\n\n## Usage\n\nutuber is split in two pieces; the server and the browser.\n\n### To start the server\n```node utuber``` (root mode)\n```node ~/node_modules/utuber/bin/utuber```\n\nTo run the server as a service, see [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever).\nFuture release will incorporate this option.\n\n### To use the client\nCreate a bookmark to your favourite browser and copy-paste the \ncontents of bookmark.html to the target. Done.\n\nThe client will show an alertbox with the results. Future releases will include a nice layer popupthingy.\n\n## TBD\nThis is a small showcase on a whim type of project, so don't expect much updates. Will do if can do.\n\n* Add security - Currently anybody can make requests, you should not run this server on a public machine\n* Nicer output - Alerts are lame\n* Options on click - Change to name and select location? Well, at least name.\n* Make the bookmark less hideous by using other than the full jQuery library for one getJSON?\n* So, so many more","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2012-11-11T13:16:54.117Z"},{"number":"0.0.2","date":"2012-11-16T10:33:44.055Z"},{"number":"0.0.3","date":"2012-11-29T12:00:55.072Z"},{"number":"0.0.4","date":"2012-11-29T13:29:39.708Z"},{"number":"0.0.5","date":"2012-12-22T22:44:01.890Z"},{"number":"0.0.6","date":"2012-12-22T22:50:31.017Z"},{"number":"0.0.7","date":"2012-12-22T22:52:54.763Z"},{"number":"0.0.8","date":"2012-12-22T22:54:55.267Z"},{"number":"0.0.9","date":"2012-12-22T23:00:07.682Z"},{"number":"0.0.10","date":"2012-12-22T23:01:54.129Z"},{"number":"0.0.11","date":"2012-12-23T11:42:34.628Z"},{"number":"0.0.12","date":"2012-12-23T12:07:47.559Z"},{"number":"0.0.13","date":"2012-12-23T12:11:15.583Z"},{"number":"0.0.14","date":"2012-12-23T12:13:30.647Z"}],"created":"2012-11-11T13:16:51.377Z","modified":"2012-12-23T12:13:30.647Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"lrdgrmrpr","email":"hater@lovehating.com"},"owners":[{"name":"lrdgrmrpr","email":"hater@lovehating.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"utuber","_npmUser":{"name":"lrdgrmrpr","email":"hater@lovehating.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.49","_rev":"1-2036358706edd25d786bdd5290ca1532","author":{"name":"LrdGrmRpr"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.14"},"dist":{"shasum":"1dd6f063f5da48b04f560aa65c93b8328b2378c5","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/utuber/-/utuber-0.0.14.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"lrdgrmrpr","email":"hater@lovehating.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2012-12-23T12:13:30.647Z","created":"2012-11-11T13:16:51.377Z","0.0.1":"2012-11-11T13:16:54.117Z","0.0.2":"2012-11-16T10:33:44.055Z","0.0.3":"2012-11-29T12:00:55.072Z","0.0.4":"2012-11-29T13:29:39.708Z","0.0.5":"2012-12-22T22:44:01.890Z","0.0.6":"2012-12-22T22:50:31.017Z","0.0.7":"2012-12-22T22:52:54.763Z","0.0.8":"2012-12-22T22:54:55.267Z","0.0.9":"2012-12-22T23:00:07.682Z","0.0.10":"2012-12-22T23:01:54.129Z","0.0.11":"2012-12-23T11:42:34.628Z","0.0.12":"2012-12-23T12:07:47.559Z","0.0.13":"2012-12-23T12:11:15.583Z","0.0.14":"2012-12-23T12:13:30.647Z"}}}
