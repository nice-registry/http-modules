Or many other things, without really touching the stuff on your hard disk.\nBoth file browsing and back-end administration are performed through a web browser.","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2012-06-06T11:16:07.343Z"},{"number":"0.1.1","date":"2012-06-12T10:00:19.214Z"},{"number":"0.1.2","date":"2012-06-14T10:07:10.240Z"},{"number":"0.1.3","date":"2012-06-15T10:49:53.461Z"},{"number":"0.1.4","date":"2012-06-18T17:42:25.233Z"},{"number":"0.1.5","date":"2012-06-19T13:10:46.321Z"},{"number":"0.1.6","date":"2012-07-03T14:16:34.661Z"},{"number":"0.1.7","date":"2012-07-03T20:47:02.816Z"}],"created":"2012-06-06T11:16:04.083Z","modified":"2012-07-03T20:47:02.816Z","owners":[{"name":"rejetto","email":"a@rejetto.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"hfs","_rev":"1-3a274084b48526b53766245791228862","author":{"name":"Massimo Melina","email":"a@rejetto.com","url":"http://rejetto.com"},"bugs":{"email":"a@rejetto.com","url":"http://www.rejetto.com/forum/index.php/board,28.0.html"},"directories":{"lib":"./lib","static":"./static"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.7"},"dist":{"shasum":"7b27044198fba2eea3ae9e64517463f14365ea5e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hfs/-/hfs-0.1.7.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"rejetto","email":"a@rejetto.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2012-07-03T20:47:02.816Z","created":"2012-06-06T11:16:04.083Z","0.1.0":"2012-06-06T11:16:07.343Z","0.1.1":"2012-06-12T10:00:19.214Z","0.1.2":"2012-06-14T10:07:10.240Z","0.1.3":"2012-06-15T10:49:53.461Z","0.1.4":"2012-06-18T17:42:25.233Z","0.1.5":"2012-06-19T13:10:46.321Z","0.1.6":"2012-07-03T14:16:34.661Z","0.1.7":"2012-07-03T20:47:02.816Z"}}}
