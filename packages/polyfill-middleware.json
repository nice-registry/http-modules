If there was no error, polyfill middleware will respond to the request.\n\n```js\nvar middleware = polyfill();\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res) {\n    // .. some logic to determine if the request should be handled by polyfill\n    middleware(req, res, function(err) {\n    });\n});\n```\n\n## examples\n\nMore examples are available in the `examples` directory.\n","created":"2014-02-11T21:17:08.425Z","modified":"2015-05-07T23:35:25.311Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"defunctzombie","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"polyfill-middleware","_npmUser":{"name":"shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.24","_rev":"1-4f2e5f988b48ed403505d10d89e23658","author":{"name":"Roman Shtylman"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/defunctzombie/polyfill-middleware/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"c13b34ff346d8701e07801b54d18a1d865670a63","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/polyfill-middleware/-/polyfill-middleware-0.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"defunctzombie","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-05-07T23:35:25.311Z","created":"2014-02-11T21:17:08.425Z","0.0.0":"2014-02-11T21:17:08.426Z"}}}
