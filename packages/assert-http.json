This library contains two primary interfaces; a test runner which executes a set of HTTP calls as described by files in a directory, and a extension to the assert module.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mapbox/assert-http.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mapbox/assert-http)\n\n[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6rnqyj048nf5k84g)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Mapbox/assert-http)\n\n## HTTP testing inferface\n\nWith [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/), usage looks like;\n\n```\ndescribe('api server', function(done) {\n    fixtures.load('/path/to/tests/').forEach(function(test) {\n        it(test.name, function(done) {\n            fixtures.runtest(test, {handlers: handlers, clean: clean}, done);\n        });\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### assertHTTP.load(dirname)\n\nSyncronous function that loads text fixtures from a directory. Returns an array of test objects.\n\n### assertHTTP.runtest(test, options, callback)\n\nRuns an individual test. Requires a test object (from assertHTTP.load), options object and callback function. The options object may contain the keys;\n\n* `handlers`; an object of keys and replacer methods for populating http requests. Handlers are async and have the function signature `function(req, value, next)`\n* `clean`; an object of keys and replacer methods for sanitizing http response headers and body. Replacer methodes have the signature `function(key, value, context)`\n\n### assertHTTP.updateFixtures()\n\nCall this method to notify assertHTTP to update fixtures as it runs.\n\n### assertHTTP.mkdirpSync(path)\n\nSync version of mkdirp\n\n### assertHTTP.md5(string)\n\nmd5 helper.\n\n### assertHTTP.imageEquals(buffer, buffer, options)\n\nA pixel-by-pixel comparison of two image buffers using the node-mapnik `Image.compare()` API. The options object may contain the keys:\n\n* `threshold`; tolerance level of RGB value difference between two pixels. Defaults to 16.\n* `diffsize`; a float between 0-1 expressing the max allowed difference between buffer lengths. Defaults to 0.1.\n* `diffpx`; a float between 0-1 expressing the max number of pixels allowed to exceed the `threshold` option. Defaults to 0.02.\n\n## Assertion module extension\n\n### assert.response(req, res, callback)\n\nIf `res.clean` is present it is expected to be a method that `json.stringify` can use to sanitize the response headers.\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2014-03-11T14:48:00.841Z","modified":"2017-05-22T16:01:06.212Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"springmeyer","email":"dane@mapbox.com"},"owners":[{"email":"accounts@mapbox.com","name":"mapbox-admin"},{"email":"tom+npm@macwright.org","name":"tmcw"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"assert-http","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/assert-http-1.1.4.tgz_1461343926807_0.44410090357996523"},"_npmUser":{"name":"springmeyer","email":"dane@mapbox.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_rev":"84-c526bfc0c30a17eaac2e92b4698475d9","_shasum":"71eae5e3e28e6e8c6ed88c5d9aa0ac383ed4088b","author":{"name":"Mapbox","email":"info@mapbox.com","url":"http://mapbox.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mapbox/assert-http/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"71eae5e3e28e6e8c6ed88c5d9aa0ac383ed4088b","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/assert-http/-/assert-http-1.1.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"accounts@mapbox.com","name":"mapbox-admin"},{"email":"tom+npm@macwright.org","name":"tmcw"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-22T16:01:06.212Z","created":"2014-03-11T14:48:00.841Z","0.0.1":"2014-03-11T14:48:00.841Z","0.0.2":"2014-04-16T22:13:57.914Z","0.0.3":"2014-05-02T20:17:27.727Z","0.0.4":"2014-05-20T23:04:54.106Z","0.0.5":"2014-05-28T17:00:20.514Z","0.0.6":"2014-06-02T20:40:17.407Z","0.0.7":"2014-06-20T20:48:36.347Z","0.0.8":"2014-06-24T16:05:39.543Z","0.0.9":"2014-06-24T23:19:21.194Z","0.1.0":"2014-09-26T16:24:07.912Z","0.2.0":"2014-10-03T14:24:05.345Z","1.0.0":"2014-10-03T14:26:37.890Z","1.0.1":"2014-11-20T12:00:23.762Z","1.0.2":"2015-05-22T14:36:40.544Z","1.0.3":"2015-08-17T17:09:01.251Z","1.0.4":"2015-09-03T14:30:09.965Z","1.1.0":"2015-11-18T22:02:33.731Z","1.1.1":"2015-11-18T22:38:49.940Z","1.1.2":"2016-01-13T17:48:48.827Z","1.1.3":"2016-02-24T16:14:09.415Z","1.1.4":"2016-04-22T16:52:07.324Z"},"users":{"adielhuhuy":true}}}
