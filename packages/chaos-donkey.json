However, as developers, we often don't check for scenarios\nthat involve non-200 responses. Thus, we deploy our SPAs expecting the best, until we're notified that our beautiful app\nis breaking in production.\n\nchaos-donkey is a [reverse-proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) that returns non-200 responses for your\nxhr requests. It allows you to see how your application will perform when things go wrong.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm i -g chaos-donkey`\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n> chaos-donkey <configuration yaml>\n\nexample:\n> chaos-donkey ./fixtures/mean-todomvc.yml\n```\n\nThe configuration yaml is a file that contains the following:\n\n```yaml\n# This is your SPA\norigin: mean-todomvc.herokuapp.com\n\nxhr:\n - path: /path/to/your/endpoint\n   # List the possible status codes you want your application to return\n   # If you don't specify this, it will return these status codes: 200, 403, 404, 500, 503\n   statusCodes:\n     - 200\n     - 500\n```\n\nSee other examples in the fixtures folder.\n","created":"2015-03-31T03:37:40.646Z","modified":"2015-03-31T03:55:24.900Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"paolodm","email":"paolodm@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"paolodm","email":"paolodm@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"chaos-donkey","_npmUser":{"name":"paolodm","email":"paolodm@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_rev":"1-deee40c5fb1bc58dd4fc107bb463d609","_shasum":"dd29f6cee61c1a56edcb83a2c3ef1de809a3e2a2","author":{"name":"Paolo del Mundo"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/paolodm/chaos-donkey/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"dd29f6cee61c1a56edcb83a2c3ef1de809a3e2a2","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/chaos-donkey/-/chaos-donkey-2.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"paolodm","email":"paolodm@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-03-31T03:55:24.900Z","created":"2015-03-31T03:37:40.646Z","2.0.0":"2015-03-31T03:37:40.646Z","2.0.1":"2015-03-31T03:52:26.976Z","2.0.2":"2015-03-31T03:55:24.900Z"}}}
