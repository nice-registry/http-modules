This plugin requires/uses a simple interface with the enpoint (only a set color URI and a get color URI). I decided to create my own RGB plugin after try to use [homebridge-better-http-rgb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-better-http-rgb) and [homebridge-http-rgb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-http-rgb) without good results due to the complex interfaces and concurrency problems/bugs.\n\n# Installation\n\n1. Follow the instruction in [homebridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge) for the homebridge server installation.\n\n2. The plugin is published through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-http-rgb-bulb) and should be installed \"globally\" by typing: `npm install -g homebridge-http-rgb-bulb`\n\n3. Update your configuration file. See [config-sample.json](https://github.com/metbosch/homebridge-http-rgb-bulb/blob/master/config-sample.json) in this repository for a sample.\n\n# Configuration\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"accessory\": \"HttpRGB\",\n  \"name\": \"RGB Bulb\",\n  \"set_url\": \"http://192.168.1.100/rgb?color=0x%s\",\n  \"get_url\": \"http://192.168.1.100/rgb?format=hex\",\n  \"http_method\": \"GET\"\n}\n```\n\nThe mandatory options are:\n * ```name``` Accessory name.\n * ```set_url``` Endpoint to call with the requested color. The module replaces the '%s' characters with the hexadecimal code value.\n * ```get_url``` Endpoint to request the current state. The response must be plain text with the hexadecimal color code (without any simbol like '0x' or '#' at the begining).\n\nThe other available options are:\n * ```manufacter``` Manufacter name to be displayed.\n * ```model``` Model name to be displayed.\n * ```serial``` Serial number to be displayed.\n * ```http_method``` Http metod that will be used to call the ```url``` when the state is requested. Default is 'GET' (check request module to get the available options).\n * ```timeout``` Miliseconds to wait for the accessory response before send an error. Default is '5000 ms'.\n","created":"2017-04-17T19:10:51.981Z","modified":"2017-04-20T07:57:27.251Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"metbosch","email":"metbosch@outlook.com"},"owners":[{"name":"metbosch","email":"metbosch@outlook.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"homebridge-http-rgb-bulb","_nodeVersion":"5.6.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/homebridge-http-rgb-bulb-0.0.2.tgz_1492675046688_0.29593027546070516"},"_npmUser":{"name":"metbosch","email":"metbosch@outlook.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.6.0","_rev":"2-98f9016035d2757092125cb1965ba575","_shasum":"3e5e59a72a1a87a66a47fae033b210cea39bf2bf","author":{"name":"@metbosch"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/metbosch/homebridge-http-rgb-bulb/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"3e5e59a72a1a87a66a47fae033b210cea39bf2bf","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/homebridge-http-rgb-bulb/-/homebridge-http-rgb-bulb-0.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"metbosch","email":"metbosch@outlook.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-20T07:57:27.251Z","created":"2017-04-17T19:10:51.981Z","0.0.1":"2017-04-17T19:10:51.981Z","0.0.2":"2017-04-20T07:57:27.251Z"}}}
