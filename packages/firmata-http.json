Connect microcontroller to computer which will run the HTTP server.\n2. Upload firmware that implements the Firmata protocol.\n3. Start this server passing it the path to the serial port\n   which connects to the microcontroller.\n\n###Dependencies\n- [Firmata Node library](https://github.com/jgautier/firmata)\n- [Express](expressjs.com)\n- [node-serialport](https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport)\n\n###Microcontroller\nOnly the Arduino Uno has been tested so far. Other hardware\nmight require some tweaking to get working. Feel free to share any\nfixes or tips.\n\n###HTTP Endpoints\n\n    GET /version/board\n      --> {\"major\": 1, \"minor\": 2}\n\nGet the major and minor version of the board.\n\n    GET /version/firmware\n      --> {\"major\": 2, \"minor\": 3, \"name\": \"StandardFirmata\"}\n\nGet the major and minor version plus the name of the firmware.\n\n    POST /pins/:num/write?type=&value=\n\nWrite data to a pin on the board.\n\n    GET /pins/:num/read?type=&channel=\n\nSubscribe to read data from a pin on the board.\nPin data is delivered by a series of events on a channel.\nUse the `GET /channels/:id` endpoint for listening to these events.\n\n    GET /channels/:id\n      --> {\"pin\": 5, \"value\": 128}\\n\n      --> {\"pin\": 10, \"value\": 0}\\n\n\nListen to a channel and receieve notification when events arrive.\nThis endpoint provides a streaming response with each event\nbeing a JSON object delimited by newline characters.\n","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2012-08-19T04:33:16.690Z"}],"created":"2012-08-19T04:33:15.234Z","modified":"2012-08-19T04:33:16.690Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jroesslein","email":"jroesslein@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"jroesslein","email":"jroesslein@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"firmata-http","_npmUser":{"name":"jroesslein","email":"jroesslein@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.49","_rev":"1-8ffc345f90e9e1e77111360be0aff905","author":{"name":"Joshua Roesslein","email":"jroesslein@gmail.com"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"f2d565ecd75014aee3701cb8c745614d44fc219e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/firmata-http/-/firmata-http-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jroesslein","email":"jroesslein@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2012-08-19T04:33:16.690Z","created":"2012-08-19T04:33:15.234Z","0.0.1":"2012-08-19T04:33:16.690Z"}}}
