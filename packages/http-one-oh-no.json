Then this package is **not** what you are looking for. 99.9% of the time you want to be making HTTP 1.1 requests, not HTTP 1.0 requests like this package makes. The built in [http](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html) module or the [request](https://www.npmjs.org/package/request) npm package is what you actually want.\n\n\nBut Then Why HTTP 1.0!?\n-----------------------\n\nBecause your server will get HTTP 1.0 requests without a `Host` header, and you should test that. Maybe there are other reasons.\n\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\nNo support for HTTPS. Only aiming to be close to `http.request()` and `http.get()`. This was all done hastily on a Sunday.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n```shell\nnpm install http-one-oh-no\n```\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nUsage is the same as the [http.request](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback) and [http.get](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_get_options_callback) functions.\n","created":"2014-05-05T06:09:20.479Z","modified":"2014-05-10T19:16:26.911Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"limulus","email":"eric@limulus.net"},"owners":[{"name":"limulus","email":"eric@limulus.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-one-oh-no","_npmUser":{"name":"limulus","email":"eric@limulus.net"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.3","_rev":"1-ad4b919a34262440c74cf370cb86ef50","author":{"name":"Eric McCarthy","email":"eric@limulus.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/limulus/http-one-oh-no/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"b66efba60be62fce430ccdf4517ebd1c8f4cae3e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-one-oh-no/-/http-one-oh-no-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"limulus","email":"eric@limulus.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-05-10T19:16:26.911Z","created":"2014-05-05T06:09:20.479Z","1.0.0":"2014-05-05T06:09:20.479Z","1.0.1":"2014-05-10T19:16:26.911Z"}}}
