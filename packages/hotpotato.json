That is, each instance of your application should not store state specific to a particular client. This approach means that if an instance goes away for whatever reason, any other instance can continue serving a particular user session. Unfortunately, this approach isn't always an option, especially if you're using a library / framework that makes this more difficult. For example, Socket.IO 1.0.\n\n\n## License \n\nhotpotato is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n","created":"2014-07-01T00:03:47.832Z","modified":"2014-07-12T11:46:02.758Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"samcday","email":"me@samcday.com.au"},"owners":[{"name":"samcday","email":"me@samcday.com.au"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"hotpotato","_npmUser":{"name":"samcday","email":"me@samcday.com.au"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.14","_rev":"1-9ebe65986890e4ffd4e57a221b56ebe0","_shasum":"a9967f8c9b53162e4c0204ef19aa69582a300e98","author":{"name":"Sam Day","email":"me@samcday.com.au"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/samcday/hotpotato/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"a9967f8c9b53162e4c0204ef19aa69582a300e98","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hotpotato/-/hotpotato-0.0.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"samcday","email":"me@samcday.com.au"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-07-12T11:46:02.758Z","created":"2014-07-01T00:03:47.832Z","0.0.0":"2014-07-01T00:03:47.832Z","0.0.1":"2014-07-03T12:41:54.925Z","0.0.2":"2014-07-04T14:06:19.967Z","0.0.3":"2014-07-05T13:08:15.991Z","0.0.4":"2014-07-12T02:49:07.371Z","0.0.5":"2014-07-12T07:26:21.775Z","0.0.6":"2014-07-12T11:46:02.758Z"}}}
