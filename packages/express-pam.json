PAM-auth uses the Basic authentication method provided by http.  If you aren't using https this is insecure because username/passwords are transported in cleartext.  \n\nThis is useful for when you don't want to have to make a user system, but you want to limit access.  With this module you can simply use your system user database to manage users.  \n\nQuick Start (Ubuntu)\n-----------\n1) To interface with PAM we need a dev package:\n   sudo apt-get install libpam0g-dev\n\n2) Install pam-auth with npm:\n   npm install pam-auth\n   (or add pam-auth to your package.json and 'npm install')\n\n3) 'use it!\n```javascript\nvar pam_auth = require('pam-auth');\napp.use(pam_auth(\"MySite\"));\n```\n\nThats it!\n\nMore Detail\n-----\nThe interface:\n   function pam_auth(realm, module)\n\nBoth arguments are optional.  Realm defaults to \"Login Required\", and module defaults to 'passwd' for linux and 'chkpasswd' for macosx.  \n\n\n","versions":[{"number":"0.2.0","date":"2012-11-27T14:56:33.168Z"}],"created":"2012-11-27T14:56:31.003Z","modified":"2012-11-27T14:56:33.168Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"poelzi","email":"git@poelzi.org"},"owners":[{"name":"poelzi","email":"git@poelzi.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"express-pam","_npmUser":{"name":"poelzi","email":"git@poelzi.org"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.62","_rev":"1-c1e5ce5a634cb9816217e8fa13877789","directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"844becf450cfcae46f869aa53f66152ae5fe9d23","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/express-pam/-/express-pam-0.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"poelzi","email":"git@poelzi.org"}],"time":{"modified":"2012-11-27T14:56:33.168Z","created":"2012-11-27T14:56:31.003Z","0.2.0":"2012-11-27T14:56:33.168Z"}}}
