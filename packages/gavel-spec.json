Gavel also decides whether the actual HTTP transaction is valid or not.\n\n### Implementations\n\n- [JavaScript][Gavel.js] [![Gavel.js Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apiaryio/gavel.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apiaryio/gavel.js) [![Relish docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-Relish-green.svg?style=flat)][Gavel.js on Relish]\n- Didn't find your favorite language? _[Add a new one!](features/add-implementation.md)_\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [Gavel on Relish][]\n\n## About `gavel-spec`\n\nThis repository contains implementation-independent behavior specification of Gavel. It's written in [Gherkin][], language used by [Cucumber][]. Two main benefits are:\n\n- Any Gavel implementation can be tested against the specification, which ensures the behavior is uniform.\n- Documentation at [Relish][] is generated from the specification, which ensures it's always up-to-date.\n\nExamples are made in raw HTTP to focus on implementation independence.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use the specification in your project and test against it, install it as [npm package][] (or include as a [git submodule][]):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install gavel-spec\n...\n$ find ./node_modules/gavel-spec/features/**/*.feature\n./node_modules/gavel-spec/features/expectations/body_json_example.feature\n./node_modules/gavel-spec/features/expectations/body_text_example.feature\n./node_modules/gavel-spec/features/expectations/headers.feature\n./node_modules/gavel-spec/features/expectations/status_code.feature\n...\n```\n\nIt's also possible to get path to the directory with features from JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nvar featuresPath = require('gavel-spec').featuresPath;\nconsole.log(featuresPath);  // prints '/.../node_modules/gavel-spec/features/'\n```\n\nUse [Cucumber][] for testing.\n\n### Publishing Documentation\n\nCurrently publishing of a new version of the generated documentation is done manually:\n\n1. Install Relish CLI: `gem install relish`\n2. Add current version: `relish versions:add apiary/gavel:1.1.0` (the `1.1.0` should be the same number which appears on npm as the latest package version)\n3. Publish new version of the documentation: `relish push apiary/gavel:1.1.0 path ./features/`\n\nSteps 2-3 has been simplified as `npm run docs:publish` command.\n\n\n[Relish]: https://www.relishapp.com/\n[Gavel on Relish]: https://www.relishapp.com/apiary/gavel\n[Gavel.js]: https://github.com/apiaryio/gavel.js\n[Gavel.js on Relish]: https://www.relishapp.com/apiary/gavel/docs/javascript/\n[Gherkin]: https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin\n[Cucumber]: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber\n[git submodule]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules\n[npm package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/gavel-spec\n","created":"2016-08-08T20:00:23.632Z","modified":"2016-08-22T15:06:33.991Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"apiary-sre","email":"sre@apiary.io"},"owners":[{"name":"apiary-sre","email":"sre@apiary.io"},{"name":"honzajavorek","email":"mail@honzajavorek.cz"},{"name":"netmilk","email":"adam@apiary.io"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"gavel-spec","_nodeVersion":"6.4.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/gavel-spec-1.2.0.tgz_1471878392022_0.2547258292324841"},"_npmUser":{"name":"apiary-sre","email":"sre@apiary.io"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.6","_rev":"1-dcb081cf540c356c60a36927fd67fb2a","_shasum":"4a8aaaacded9f6abc34b4bdab7bdb2e425819cbe","author":{"name":"Apiary Czech Republic, s.r.o.","email":"support@apiary.io"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/apiaryio/gavel-spec/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"4a8aaaacded9f6abc34b4bdab7bdb2e425819cbe","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/gavel-spec/-/gavel-spec-1.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"apiary-sre","email":"sre@apiary.io"},{"name":"honzajavorek","email":"mail@honzajavorek.cz"},{"name":"netmilk","email":"adam@apiary.io"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-08-22T15:06:33.991Z","created":"2016-08-08T20:00:23.632Z","1.1.0":"2016-08-08T20:00:23.632Z","1.2.0":"2016-08-22T15:06:33.991Z"}}}
