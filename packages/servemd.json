If a file is a `.md`\nfile, it will render the Markdown into HTML. It will serve `README.md` or\n`index.html` when a directory is requested if either exist.\n\nBy default the [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) (v2.3.1) CSS\nfile is linked to the generated HTML documents. Markdown is parsed by the\n[marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) library.\n\nI made this project because I wanted the easiest way to preview documentation\nfiles that would be uploaded to Github. Many existing utilities change the file\nname (e.g. request `test.html` for the `test.md` file) or are too hard to\nsetup. Note that this is probably *not* secure, it is *not* meant for\ndevelopment purposes.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall using NPM: `npm install servemd -g`\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh\nservemd &                   # Starts the server on port 3000\ncurl http://localhost:3000/ # Get the contents of the README.md file rendered\n```\n\nOptions:\n\n```sh\nservemd -d ~/           # Serves files from specified directory\nservemd -p 1234         # Listens on the specified port\nservemd -s mystyles.css # Link the specified CSS file to the HTML\nservemd --help          # Get more help\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nIt currently does *not* do any syntax highlighting.\n\n","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2013-03-19T16:27:55.728Z"}],"created":"2013-03-19T16:27:54.463Z","modified":"2013-03-19T16:27:55.729Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"conradz","email":"me@conradz.com"},"owners":[{"name":"conradz","email":"me@conradz.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"servemd","_npmUser":{"name":"conradz","email":"me@conradz.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.66","_rev":"1-e04f79325a73bbe638e4b3ccb4c0b950","directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"5b822b891e7f1a7b82bd72ceae59f588f37e8e1d","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/servemd/-/servemd-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"conradz","email":"me@conradz.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-03-19T16:27:55.729Z","created":"2013-03-19T16:27:54.463Z","0.0.1":"2013-03-19T16:27:55.728Z"}}}
