Obviously, it's not meant for production use.\n\nYou don't need to restart the server every time you make a file change, as it reads the requested files with each request.\n\n*Note:* I am aware I could have implemented this using `connect`'s full featured static server instead, but I didn't. Why? For fun, of course!\n\n## Usage\n\n\tUsage: localserver [options]\n\t\n\t  Options:\n\t  \n    -h, --help           output usage information\n    -V, --version        output the version number\n    -p, --port [port]    Start static server on specified port. Defaults to \"9000\"\n    --index [index]      Specify index file. Defaults to \"index.html\"\n    --favicon [favicon]  If specified, will log a request to \"/favicon.ico\".\n\n## TODO\n\n- Ability to specify caching headers\n- `.localserver.yml` config file support\n","created":"2013-08-11T13:24:31.077Z","modified":"2014-05-22T11:05:32.955Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"nsmeta","email":"nsmeta@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"nsmeta","email":"nsmeta@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"localserver","_npmUser":{"name":"nsmeta","email":"nsmeta@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.3","_rev":"1-d5886730b4554f8084d80ee288667e88","author":{"name":"Arturas Lebedevas","email":"nsmeta@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/MixinLabs/node-localserver/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"19a1dc7ea143c971697f4502308427f896130f17","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/localserver/-/localserver-0.1.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"nsmeta","email":"nsmeta@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-05-22T11:05:32.955Z","created":"2013-08-11T13:24:31.077Z","0.1.0":"2013-08-11T13:24:33.946Z","0.1.1":"2013-08-11T13:56:21.764Z","0.1.2":"2013-08-11T14:01:55.910Z","0.1.3":"2013-08-11T14:43:26.819Z","0.1.4":"2014-05-22T11:05:32.955Z"}}}
