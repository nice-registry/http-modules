Redirects http requests to https. Tested on Express 4.x\n\n## Install\n\n    npm install force-ssl\n\n## Usage\n\nPrerequisites for this example:\n\n    npm install express self-signed-https force-ssl\n\nJavascript code (paste into app.js):\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express')\nvar selfSignedHttps = require('self-signed-https')\nvar forceSsl = require('force-ssl')\n\nvar app = express()\napp.listen(80) // http on port 80\nselfSignedHttps(app).listen(443) // https on port 443\napp.use(forceSsl)\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send('hello world')\n})\n```\n\nYou may need to run it as root (since it listens on port 80):\n\n    sudo node app.js\n\nNow if you visit http://localhost, it should redirect you to https://localhost\n\n## Options\n\nIf HTTPS is running on a different port, then set the https_port option to specify it:\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express')\nvar selfSignedHttps = require('self-signed-https')\nvar forceSsl = require('force-ssl')\n\nvar app = express()\napp.listen(3000) // http on port 3000\nselfSignedHttps(app).listen(3001) // https on port 3001\nforceSsl.https_port = 3001 // specify that https is running on port 3001\napp.use(forceSsl)\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send('hello world')\n})\n```\n\nNow if you visit http://localhost:3000, it should redirect you to https://localhost:3001\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Credits\n\n[Geza Kovacs](https://github.com/gkovacs)\n","created":"2014-12-29T03:23:07.191Z","modified":"2014-12-29T20:32:16.615Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"geza","email":"geza0kovacs@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"geza","email":"geza0kovacs@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"force-ssl","_npmUser":{"name":"geza","email":"geza0kovacs@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.0.0-beta.0","_rev":"1-19231a0c719152ddcd6cf891f64a401b","_shasum":"4ec50705d6b9e4184ca227a51dc464af9dff21dc","author":{"name":"Geza Kovacs","url":"http://github.com/gkovacs"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gkovacs/force-ssl/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.5"},"dist":{"shasum":"4ec50705d6b9e4184ca227a51dc464af9dff21dc","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/force-ssl/-/force-ssl-1.0.5.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"geza","email":"geza0kovacs@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-12-29T20:32:16.615Z","created":"2014-12-29T03:23:07.191Z","1.0.0":"2014-12-29T03:23:07.191Z","1.0.2":"2014-12-29T03:45:42.979Z","1.0.3":"2014-12-29T03:58:29.525Z","1.0.4":"2014-12-29T04:21:25.925Z","1.0.5":"2014-12-29T20:32:16.615Z"}}}
