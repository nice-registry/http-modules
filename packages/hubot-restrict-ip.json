IP can also be IPv6 ranges.\n- the endpoints are a list of endpoints, separated by commas too, like `/hubot/help` but it can also be a regexp like `/.*/help`\n\nTesting\n----------------\n\n    npm install\n\n    # will run make test and coffeelint\n    npm test \n    \n    # or\n    make test\n    \n    # or, for watch-mode\n    make test-w\n\n    # or for more documentation-style output\n    make test-spec\n\n    # and to generate coverage\n    make test-cov\n\n    # and to run the lint\n    make lint\n\n    # run the lint and the coverage\n    make\n\nChangelog\n---------------\nAll changes are listed in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)\n\nContribute\n--------------\nFeel free to open a PR if you find any bug, typo, want to improve documentation, or think about a new feature. \n\nGandi loves Free and Open Source Software.
