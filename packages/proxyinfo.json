I highly suggest that you don't run this as `root` user. Read this [article][1] to learn about how to setup your Node.js app as a service.\n\n### Using as a library\n\n```javascript\nvar proxyinfo = require('proxyinfo');\nproxyinfo.createProxyApp({countryLookup: true}, function(app){\n\t//your logic here\n\n\tapp.listen(80);\n});\n```\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright 2012, JP Richardson\n\nSee [LICENSE][license] for more details. \n\n[1]: http://www.exratione.com/2011/07/running-a-nodejs-server-as-a-service-using-forever.php\n[license]: https://github.com/jprichardson/node-proxyinfo/blob/master/LICENSE","created":"2012-02-09T21:44:13.812Z","modified":"2015-01-23T21:58:30.830Z","owners":[{"name":"jprichardson","email":"jprichardson@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"proxyinfo","_rev":"1-43c95ac69241c0c36a07e981f4e8aebf","author":{"name":"JP Richardson","email":"jprichardson@gmail.com"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"6210c2b3d47ca0287749735affe9a39fd018e475","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/proxyinfo/-/proxyinfo-0.0.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jprichardson","email":"jprichardson@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"","time":{"modified":"2015-01-23T21:58:30.830Z","created":"2012-02-09T21:44:13.812Z","0.0.1":"2012-02-09T21:44:16.279Z","0.0.2":"2012-02-10T03:46:53.999Z","0.0.3":"2012-02-10T04:12:43.744Z","0.0.4":"2012-02-10T04:17:31.832Z","0.0.5":"2012-02-10T04:20:05.992Z","0.0.6":"2012-09-10T05:50:34.911Z"}}}
