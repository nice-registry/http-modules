Create a file named \"localhost\" in '[..]/node_modules/cendre/conf/vhosts' and put the following lines in it :\n```javascript\nexports.hostname = 'localhost';\nexports.host = require('../base.nodejs')();\nexports.host.root = '/var/www';\n```\nThen launch Cendre by typing this command :\n```bash\n$ npm start cendre\n```\n\n## Develop\n\nYou can code your own dynamic pages. They have the .nodejs extension by default.\n\nHere is the minimal code :\n```javascript\nexports.mimetype = 'text/plain';\nexports.encoding = 'utf-8';\n\nexports.run = function(c, end)\n{\n\tend('Hello world !');\n};\n```\nIt will return an UTF-8 encoded .txt file with \"Hello world !\" as content.\n\n### Changelog\n\nV5.0.0 :\n\n* Added generator support.\n* Security
