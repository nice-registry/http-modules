It uses `node_pcap`.  Install it with:\n\n    npm install http_trace\n\n## Usage `http_trace [options]`\n\n    Capture options:\n        -i <interface>           interface name for capture (def: first with an addr)\n        -f <pcap_filter>         packet filter in pcap-filter(7) syntax (def: all TCP packets)\n        -b <buffer>              size in MB to buffer between libpcap and app (def: 10)\n\n    HTTP filtering:\n        Filters are OR-ed together and may be specified more than once.\n        Show filters are applied first, then ignore filters.\n        --method <regex>            show requests with this method\n        --method-ignore <regex>     ignore requests with this method\n        --host <regex>              show requests with this Host header\n        --host-ignore <regex>       ignore requests with this Host header\n        --url <regex>               show requests with this URL\n        --url-ignore <regex>        ignore requests with this URL\n        --user-agent <regex>        show requests with this UA header\n        --user-agent-ignore <regex> ignore requests with this UA header\n\n    HTTP output:\n        --headers                print headers of request and response (def: off)\n        --bodies                 print request and response bodies, if any (def: off)\n        --tcp-verbose            display TCP events (def: off)\n        --no-color               disable ANSI colors (def: pretty colors on)\n\n    Examples:\n        http_trace -f \"tcp port 80\"\n           listen for TCP port 80 on the default device\n        http_trace -i eth1 --method POST\n           listen on eth1 for all traffic that has an HTTP POST\n        http_trace --host ranney --headers\n           matches ranney in Host header and prints req/res headers\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![http_trace screenshot](http://ranney.com/httptrace.jpg)\n\n\nThe TCP tracker in `node_pcap` looks for HTTP at the beginning of every TCP connection.\nIf found, all captured data on this connection will be fed to node's HTTP parser and events will be generated.\n`http_trace` has listeners for these events and will print out some helpful information.\n\nIf a WebSocket upgrade is detected, `http_trace` will start looking for WebSocket messages on that connection.\n","created":"2011-01-19T00:56:57.449Z","modified":"2015-02-01T02:01:26.901Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mjr","email":"mjr@ranney.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mjr","email":"mjr@ranney.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http_trace","_nodeVersion":"0.10.32","_npmUser":{"name":"mjr","email":"mjr@ranney.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.4.1","_rev":"1-d5ca5c3cc23e43b6fd2bdc6264739919","_shasum":"67723b3e7752dd8b10c8ac2bb2cd843728e2f116","author":{"name":"Matt Ranney","email":"mjr@ranney.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mranney/http_trace/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"67723b3e7752dd8b10c8ac2bb2cd843728e2f116","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http_trace/-/http_trace-0.5.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mjr","email":"mjr@ranney.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-02-01T02:01:26.901Z","created":"2011-01-19T00:56:57.449Z","0.2.4":"2011-01-19T00:56:57.449Z","0.2.5":"2011-01-19T00:56:57.449Z","0.3.0":"2011-02-01T19:39:58.409Z","0.4.0":"2015-01-01T03:49:18.552Z","0.5.0":"2015-02-01T02:01:26.901Z"}}}
