This library is packaged as a npm package\n\n## How does it work\nFrom the directory of the art code install the package as follows:\n```sh\nnpm install testx-http-keywords --save\n```\n\nAfter installing the package add the keywords to your protractor config file as follows:\n\n```\ntestx.keywords.add(require('testx-http-keywords'))\n```\n\n## Keywords\n\n| Keyword                   | Argument name | Argument value  | Description | Supports repeating arguments |\n| ----------------------    | ------------- | --------------- |------------ | ---------------------------- |\n| send http [optional request method] request         |               |                 | send a http POST request and check if the response status code is 200 |  |\n|                           | url           | relative url to which the request will be sent || No |\n|                           | method        | request method  | Optional. Valid values are **get**, **post**, **put** and **delete**. Defaults to **get**. It is also possible to put the methid in the keyword, as in **send http post request** or **send http delete request** instead of providing this argument. | No |\n|                           | json          | a valid JSON string that contains the body of the request, will make the Content-Type of the request 'application/json' | Optional. Cannot use it together with **body**. | No |\n|                           | body          | a string that contains the body of the request | Optional. Cannot use it together with **json**. | No |\n|                           | headers       | custom headers | Optional. Semicolon or new line-separated string of '='-separated key-value pairs. For example \"User-Agent=testx;Something-Else='value with spaces'\"| No |\n|                           | expected status code   | expected status code of the response | Optional. The test will fail if the actual status code is different; defaults to 200| No |\n|                           | expected response  | expected content of the response | Optional. The test will fail if the actual content (body) of the response is not equal. | No |\n|                           | expected response regex | a regex to match against the response | Optional. The keyword will try to match the provided regular expression against the content (body) of the response and will fail if there is no match; currently it is not possible to provide regex matching options. | No |\n|                           | expected headers | list of expected response headers | Optional. Same format as the *headers* parameter. The keyword will fail if not all of the expected response headers exist or if they have values different than the expected/specified onesble to provide regex matching options. | No |\n|                           | *json path/xpath* | *expected value at this json path or xpath* | Optional. Depending on the **Content-Type** header this argument will be treated as JSON path or an XPath. The argument name should be the actual path, i.e. \"$.address.city\" or \"//address/city\". | Yes |\n","created":"2015-09-14T13:20:38.252Z","modified":"2017-05-17T06:56:57.021Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"greyarch","email":"gantcho@greyarch.net"},"owners":[{"name":"greyarch","email":"gantcho@greyarch.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"testx-http-keywords","_nodeVersion":"7.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/testx-http-keywords-0.13.1.tgz_1495004216183_0.18723145360127091"},"_npmUser":{"name":"greyarch","email":"gantcho@greyarch.net"},"_npmVersion":"4.6.1","_rev":"10-6c04d8c3ff9b6d3b4932d117c78c5210","_shasum":"3d47508a5663f5ede2aefe5d959f20981b33e624","author":{"name":"Greyarch BV"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.13.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"3d47508a5663f5ede2aefe5d959f20981b33e624","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/testx-http-keywords/-/testx-http-keywords-0.13.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"greyarch","email":"gantcho@greyarch.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-17T06:56:57.021Z","created":"2015-09-14T13:20:38.252Z","0.1.0":"2015-09-14T13:20:38.252Z","0.1.1":"2015-09-15T09:02:50.744Z","0.2.0":"2015-09-22T09:57:00.728Z","0.2.1":"2015-09-24T09:06:54.197Z","0.3.0":"2015-10-13T09:47:38.536Z","0.3.1":"2015-10-13T12:46:10.984Z","0.3.2":"2015-10-13T13:05:41.141Z","0.4.0":"2016-07-14T14:14:10.376Z","0.5.0":"2016-07-21T09:54:16.685Z","0.6.0":"2016-08-08T10:24:54.354Z","0.7.0":"2016-08-22T11:24:17.139Z","0.8.0":"2016-09-01T07:14:28.601Z","0.8.1":"2016-12-13T13:55:53.312Z","0.9.0":"2016-12-21T10:53:33.271Z","0.9.1":"2016-12-21T12:11:17.813Z","0.10.0":"2017-03-06T10:53:10.924Z","0.11.0":"2017-04-04T11:30:30.952Z","0.11.1":"2017-04-05T08:22:06.222Z","0.12.0":"2017-04-05T09:58:14.412Z","0.13.0":"2017-05-16T13:12:30.298Z","0.13.1":"2017-05-17T06:56:57.021Z"}}}
