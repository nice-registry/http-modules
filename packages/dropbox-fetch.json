This is mainly a personal project that I started because Dropbox does not provide a Javascript wrapper for their API, and most other projects that I found here on Github that do this are no longer maintained anymore or otherwise unsuitable for me.\n\nThese functions that implement the Dropbox HTTP API all are pure functions (except for the network request that is being sent, of course). They return a promise which resolves with the complete result that the API returns.\n\nThere is a convenience function `setToken` that allows you to set your token once and omit this in your subsequent function calls.\n\n## Requirements\n\nYou'll obviously need a Dropbox user account in order create a Dropbox app on their [*apps*](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) page.\nWhile this application is in development (version < `1.x`), you'll need node.js version `6` to run it because I use some fancy ES6 features.\nI will probably support the LTS version of node.js sometime in the future.\n\n## Examples\n\n### upload\n\n``` js\nconst box = require('dropbox-fetch');\n\nconst apiArgs = {\n  path: '/foo/bar.txt' // this is were your file will be stored in your dropbox\n  // optional parameters are omitted (see JSDoc of the upload function)\n};\n/* \n * Now read the file content - you could also pass just the content as a string\n * to the upload function (if you wish to create a textfile), but I recommend\n * using a ReadStream, because it also works with images etc.\n */\nconst content = fs.createReadStream('foo.txt');\nconst token = config.token; // your personal access token\n\n// upload the file to your dropbox\nbox.upload(apiArgs, content, token).then((result) => {\n  // do whatever you want with the response\n  console.log(result.status); // 200 (hopefully)\n  // result.status could also be 400 or 500, these also result in a resolved promise\n}).catch((result) => {\n  console.err('something went wrong'); \n});\n```\n\n### download\n\n``` js\nconst path = '/foo/bar.txt'; // whatever file you wish to download\nconst token = config.token; // your personal access token\n\nbox.download(path, token).then((result) => {\n  return result.text(); // promise that resolves with the file's content as a string\n}).then((fileContent) => {\n  // do whatever you want with the file's contents, e.g. write to a file or just log\n  console.log(fileContent);\n});\n```\n\n### getMetadata\n\n``` js\n\nconst validPath = '/tape-test/' + filename; // not neccessarily existing\nconst token = config.token; // your personal access token\n\nbox.getMetadata(validPath, true, true, true, token).then((result) => {\n  if (result.status === 200) {\n    // obtain the files metadata via result.json() (returns a promise)\n    console.log('success');\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Features / Upcoming\n\nFeatures:\n\n- `upload`\n- `download`\n- `getMetadata`\n\nUpcoming:\n\n- `authorize`\n- `listFiles`\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou're welcome to contribute a feature to this repository. If you do, please make sure that it passes the linter (run `npm run lint`) and add a short unit test to *test/dropbox-fetch.js* (which should, obviously, pass - run the tests using `npm run test`).\n","created":"2016-06-14T18:12:57.415Z","modified":"2016-09-17T22:51:02.265Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"janis-kra","email":"krasemann.janis@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"janis-kra","email":"krasemann.janis@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"dropbox-fetch","_nodeVersion":"6.3.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/dropbox-fetch-0.3.2.tgz_1474152660490_0.8029915415681899"},"_npmUser":{"name":"janis-kra","email":"krasemann.janis@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.3","_rev":"1-34782cbcb14e123265791ceea1b674db","_shasum":"fc4c736d2af6b4d6df6b41f1688e97e03938fe85","author":{"name":"Janis Krasemann"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/janis-kra/dropbox-fetch/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"fc4c736d2af6b4d6df6b41f1688e97e03938fe85","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/dropbox-fetch/-/dropbox-fetch-0.3.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"janis-kra","email":"krasemann.janis@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-09-17T22:51:02.265Z","created":"2016-06-14T18:12:57.415Z","0.1.1":"2016-06-14T18:12:57.415Z","0.1.2":"2016-06-15T13:06:42.523Z","0.1.3":"2016-06-16T07:23:32.288Z","0.1.4":"2016-06-17T13:26:07.908Z","0.1.5":"2016-06-17T16:33:39.864Z","0.2.0":"2016-06-19T16:27:16.466Z","0.2.1":"2016-06-19T16:32:10.278Z","0.3.0":"2016-06-21T13:16:15.422Z","0.3.2":"2016-09-17T22:51:02.265Z"}}}
