You may also want to run `npm link` so that whenever you call `require('riak-js')` it will always point to the current dev version.\n\nTest with `cake test` or `cake -s test`. Requires [Vows](http://vowsjs.org) 0.5.2.\n\n### Features and documentation\n\n[http://riakjs.org](http://riakjs.org)\n\nTwitter: [@riakjs](http://twitter.com/riakjs)\n\n### Roadmap\n\n - 1.0: Pure Javascript, simplify code, first-class support for streams, faster and reliable tests (via test backend), support for Riak 1.0 features.
