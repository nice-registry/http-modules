When the back-end is ready, just remove it and it's using the back-end with no changes in your application code.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\n    npm install ng2-mock-server [--save | --save-dev]\n\nIn your `bootstrap.ts` or `main.ts` file:\n\n    import {Http} from '@angular/http';\n    import {MOCK_SERVER_PROVIDERS, MockSrvRouter, res} from 'ng2-mock-server/http';\n\n    bootstrap([\n        // your normal providers\n        Http,\n        MOCK_SERVER_PROVIDERS,\n    ], AppComponent).then(app => {\n        let router = <MockSrvRouter> app.injector.get(MockSrvRouter);\n\n        // Define and implement the routes.\n        router.setup(r => {\n            r.get(\"/hello\", (req : Request, ...params : string) {\n               return res(200, \"world\");\n            });\n\n            r.get(\"/hello/:name\", (req : Request, name : string) {\n                return res(200, name);\n            });\n        });\n    });\n\nNote, you can also define the setup function somewhere else and just pass it to `router.setup()` to keep the main (or bootstrap) file short and clean. See the [example/main.ts](example/main.ts) and [example/setupMockRouter.ts](example/setupMockRouter.ts) files.\n\nDevelopment and running the example project\n-------------------------------------------\n\nFor development and running the example project, clone this repo, make the desired changes and:\n\n    # 1. link the module:\n    npm link ng2-mock-server\n\n    # 2. run the example with\n    npm start\n\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\n#### 0.0.3\n\n- Fixed #3, a bug where `onComplete` callbacks weren't called after a request.\n- Make `router.setup(r => {...})` the default way of setting up the routes to eliminate the call to `r.ready()`. This is backwards-compatible so if you're not using `router.setup()` and call `router.ready()`, everything will work just fine.\n\n#### 0.0.2\n\n- Updated code to Angular2 RC 1.\n- Thanks [Stephan Beal][sgbeal] for the code!\n\n#### 0.0.1\n\nInitial release.\n\nContributions\n-------------\n\nPlease create issues with bug reports, feature requests or asking for help.\n\nPull requests more than welcome.\n\nLicence\n-------\n\nReleased under the MIT Licence.\n\n[sgbeal]: https://github.com/sgbeal\n","created":"2016-03-08T17:45:48.129Z","modified":"2016-05-31T11:56:07.103Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"vla_ve","email":"vlad.velici@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"vla_ve","email":"vlad.velici@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ng2-mock-server","_nodeVersion":"5.4.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/ng2-mock-server-0.0.3.tgz_1464695764840_0.9536718125455081"},"_npmUser":{"name":"vla_ve","email":"vlad.velici@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.7.1","_rev":"1-c5abb16b88593feac15b0b967fdf6c85","_shasum":"dcebcda27cea09fd916ff31c82677bae0ca49335","author":{"name":"Vlad Velici","url":"http://vladvelici.github.io"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/vladvelici/ng2-mock-server/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"dcebcda27cea09fd916ff31c82677bae0ca49335","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ng2-mock-server/-/ng2-mock-server-0.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"vla_ve","email":"vlad.velici@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-05-31T11:56:07.103Z","created":"2016-03-08T17:45:48.129Z","0.0.1":"2016-03-08T17:45:48.129Z","0.0.2":"2016-05-19T14:25:35.772Z","0.0.3":"2016-05-31T11:56:07.103Z"}}}
