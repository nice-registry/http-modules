This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright (C) 2016 and above Shogun <shogun@cowtech.it>.\n\nLicensed under the MIT license, which can be found at http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2016-09-20T07:16:35.193Z"},{"number":"0.3.0","date":"2016-09-20T07:19:53.441Z"},{"number":"0.4.0","date":"2016-09-20T10:08:05.761Z"},{"number":"0.5.0","date":"2016-09-26T07:24:13.386Z"},{"number":"0.6.0","date":"2016-11-14T09:33:55.179Z"},{"number":"0.6.1","date":"2016-11-14T10:06:27.356Z"},{"number":"0.6.2","date":"2016-11-14T10:23:17.241Z"},{"number":"0.6.3","date":"2016-11-14T10:42:34.848Z"},{"number":"0.6.4","date":"2016-12-10T11:12:10.284Z"},{"number":"0.6.5","date":"2016-12-10T11:13:20.446Z"},{"number":"0.7.0","date":"2016-12-14T11:05:53.715Z"},{"number":"0.7.1","date":"2016-12-14T11:14:51.485Z"},{"number":"0.7.2","date":"2016-12-14T11:41:14.110Z"},{"number":"0.7.3","date":"2016-12-14T11:49:35.930Z"},{"number":"0.7.4","date":"2016-12-14T12:07:07.500Z"},{"number":"0.7.5","date":"2016-12-14T12:14:16.011Z"},{"number":"0.7.6","date":"2016-12-15T10:41:52.670Z"},{"number":"0.7.7","date":"2016-12-15T12:54:01.550Z"},{"number":"0.7.8","date":"2016-12-15T12:54:23.907Z"}],"created":"2016-09-20T07:16:35.193Z","modified":"2016-12-15T12:54:23.907Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"shogun_panda","email":"shogun@cowtech.it"},"owners":[{"name":"shogun_panda","email":"shogun@cowtech.it"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"apes","_nodeVersion":"7.2.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/apes-0.7.8.tgz_1481806461707_0.8250453528016806"},"_npmUser":{"name":"shogun_panda","email":"shogun@cowtech.it"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.9","_rev":"16-40ef6ecd633713a3196f9b51fba11a0c","_shasum":"92b35c5b4e0c5dc681963f8a09534385da883277","author":{"name":"Shogun","email":"shogun@cowtech.it"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ShogunPanda/apes/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.7.8"},"dist":{"shasum":"92b35c5b4e0c5dc681963f8a09534385da883277","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/apes/-/apes-0.7.8.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"shogun_panda","email":"shogun@cowtech.it"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-12-15T12:54:23.907Z","created":"2016-09-20T07:16:35.193Z","0.1.0":"2016-09-20T07:16:35.193Z","0.3.0":"2016-09-20T07:19:53.441Z","0.4.0":"2016-09-20T10:08:05.761Z","0.5.0":"2016-09-26T07:24:13.386Z","0.6.0":"2016-11-14T09:33:55.179Z","0.6.1":"2016-11-14T10:06:27.356Z","0.6.2":"2016-11-14T10:23:17.241Z","0.6.3":"2016-11-14T10:42:34.848Z","0.6.4":"2016-12-10T11:12:10.284Z","0.6.5":"2016-12-10T11:13:20.446Z","0.7.0":"2016-12-14T11:05:53.715Z","0.7.1":"2016-12-14T11:14:51.485Z","0.7.2":"2016-12-14T11:41:14.110Z","0.7.3":"2016-12-14T11:49:35.930Z","0.7.4":"2016-12-14T12:07:07.500Z","0.7.5":"2016-12-14T12:14:16.011Z","0.7.6":"2016-12-15T10:41:52.670Z","0.7.7":"2016-12-15T12:54:01.550Z","0.7.8":"2016-12-15T12:54:23.907Z"}}}
