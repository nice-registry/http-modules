It has no DoS protection and simplicity and\ncorrectness is prioritized over performance.\n\nIf you need extreme performance you should consider\nhttps://github.com/petkaantonov/querystringparser.\n\nThis package was written because serialization seems to happen most often on\nthe client as a single operation and similar performance-focused libraries had\ntrade-offs and bugs while others carried huge dependencies.\n\n```js\nvar stringify = require('http-querystring-stringify');\n\nstringify({\n\tfirst: 'John',\n\tlast: 'Wayne',\n});\n// -> first=John&last=Wayne\n\nstringify({\n\tbrands: [ 'KitKat', 'Snickers', 'Bounty' ],\n});\n// -> brands[]=KitKat&brands[]=Snickers&brands[]=Bounty\n\nstringify({\n\tsites: [\n\t\t{ name: 'facebook', 'color': 'blue' },\n\t],\n});\n// -> sites[0][name]=facebook&sites[0][color]=blue\n```\n\n- `toJSON` is respected (like `JSON.stringify` does)\n- `true` and `false` are converted to `y` or `n` respectively\n- `null` is represented by an empty string\n- `undefined` values will be skipped completely\n- arrays will be numbered only if they contain arrays or objects themselves\n","created":"2016-12-29T23:56:35.683Z","modified":"2016-12-29T23:56:35.683Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"thomas-jensen","email":"thomas@src.agency"},"owners":[{"name":"thomas-jensen","email":"thomas@src.agency"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-querystring-stringify","_nodeVersion":"7.2.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http-querystring-stringify-1.0.0.tgz_1483055793536_0.881738219410181"},"_npmUser":{"name":"thomas-jensen","email":"thomas@src.agency"},"_npmVersion":"4.0.3","_rev":"1-63ffcbc3c0432028a0d4528289b4826f","_shasum":"8295bfe1f2c7f994c0adc6117555277e42f15373","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/srcagency/http-querystring-stringify/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"8295bfe1f2c7f994c0adc6117555277e42f15373","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-querystring-stringify/-/http-querystring-stringify-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"thomas-jensen","email":"thomas@src.agency"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-12-29T23:56:35.683Z","created":"2016-12-29T23:56:35.683Z","1.0.0":"2016-12-29T23:56:35.683Z"}}}
