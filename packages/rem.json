Rem 0.6\n\nAn HTTP Client with middleware, with built-in support for major web services.\n\nTo use Rem with Node.js, install using `npm`:\n\n    npm install rem\n\nTo use in the browser, include `lib/rem.js`.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nA Node.js script to access and configure the Github API, in just 6 lines:\n\n```javascript\nvar rem = require('rem');\nrem.connect('github.com').prompt(function (err, user) {\n  user('user').get(function (err, profile) {\n    console.log('Hello %s!', profile.name);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n`rem.connect('github.com')` creates a Github API Client. `prompt` asks you for API configuration and prompts you to log in. `user` is an authenticated API that can access [endpoints like `'user'`](http://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-the-authenticated-user), returning a JSON blob like `profile.name`.\n\n## Documentation\n\nLook at [**the Wiki for API Documentation**](https://github.com/tcr/rem/wiki).\n\n* See [code for popular REST services](https://github.com/tcr/rem/tree/master/examples/services).\n* See [code for using Rem to authenticate users](https://github.com/tcr/rem/tree/master/examples/auth) with Express, from the command line, or out-of-band login.\n* See [code for using Rem in the browser](https://github.com/tcr/rem/tree/master/examples/browser).\n\n##
