By exploring the\nlayer underlying all frameworks you get a powerful tool in your arsenal,\nallowing you to quickly create `http` connections by just running\n`require('http')`.\n\nThis adventure is smaller in scope than [`learnyounode`](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode)\nwhich teaches most of the node basics. If you're completely new to Node it's\nrecommended to start there.\n\nIf you're completely new to JavaScript it's recommended you try out\n[`javascripting`](http://ghub.io/javascripting).\n\nIf you're here to just learn some `http`,  I welcome you traveller!\n\n## See Also\n- [api/http](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html)\n\n## License\n[MIT](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license)\n\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/http-adventure.svg?style=flat-square\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/http-adventure\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/http-adventure.svg?style=flat-square\n[downloads-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/http-adventure\n","created":"2014-12-21T21:59:52.366Z","modified":"2014-12-21T22:10:51.087Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"yoshuawuyts","email":"i@yoshuawuyts.com"},"owners":[{"name":"yoshuawuyts","email":"i@yoshuawuyts.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-adventure","_nodeVersion":"0.10.33","_npmUser":{"name":"yoshuawuyts","email":"i@yoshuawuyts.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.1.12","_rev":"1-d3356bcf0c34bce6bcb3a1c5bf9bbcd8","_shasum":"2751d0b77bc08169c0eea054878390441245e1be","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/http-adventure/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"2751d0b77bc08169c0eea054878390441245e1be","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-adventure/-/http-adventure-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"yoshuawuyts","email":"i@yoshuawuyts.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-12-21T22:10:51.087Z","created":"2014-12-21T21:59:52.366Z","1.0.0":"2014-12-21T21:59:52.366Z","1.0.1":"2014-12-21T22:10:51.087Z"}}}
