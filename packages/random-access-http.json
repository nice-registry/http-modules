There are also an abundance of free cloud hosts that let you host large files over http.\n\nThis module provides you random access to a file hosted over http so that it can be used by a client in a distributed system (such as hypercore or hyperdrive) to acquire parts of the file for itself and the other peers in the swarm.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar randomAccessHttp = require('random-access-http')\n\nvar file = randomAccessHttp('http://example.com/somefile.mp4')\n\n// Read 10 bytes at an offset of 5\nfile.read(5, 10, function(err, buffer) {\n  console.log(buffer)\n  file.close(function() {\n    console.log('http keepalive agents and sockets destroyed')\n  })\n})\n```\n\nfile will use a keepalive agent to reduce the number http requests needed for the session.  When you are done you should call `file.close()` to destroy the agent.\n\n## API\n\n#### `var file = randomAccessFile(url)`\n\nCreate a new 'file' that reads from the provided `url`.  The `url` can be either `http` or `https`.\n\n#### `file.write(offset, buffer, [callback])`\n\nNot implemented!  Please let me know if you have opinions on how to implement this.\n\n#### `file.read(offset, length, callback)`\n\nRead a buffer at a specific offset. Callback is called with the buffer read.  Currently this will fail if the server returns byte ranges different than what is requested.  PRs welcome to expand the flexibility of this method to allow for servers that return fat ranges.\n\n#### `file.close([callback])`\n\nClose outstanding http keepalive agent sockets.\n\n#### `file.on('open')`\n\nEmitted when the url has been checked to support range requests and the keep-alive agent has been created.\n\n#### `file.on('close')`\n\nEmitted after the keepalive agent and its associated sockets have been destroyed.\n\n## See Also\n\n- [bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019 WebSeed - HTTP/FTP Seeding (GetRight style)](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html)\n- [bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0017 HTTP Seeding (Hoffman-style)](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0017.html)\n- [RFC2616 14.35.1 Byte Ranges](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.35)\n- [random-access-file](https://github.com/mafintosh/random-access-file)\n- [random-access-memory](https://github.com/mafintosh/random-access-memory)\n- [hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore)\n","created":"2016-06-21T21:31:59.542Z","modified":"2017-04-20T16:18:41.493Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"bret","email":"bcomnes@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"bret","email":"bcomnes@gmail.com"},{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},{"name":"maxogden","email":"max@maxogden.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"random-access-http","_nodeVersion":"6.2.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/random-access-http-1.0.1.tgz_1466545043655_0.21538138994947076"},"_npmUser":{"name":"bret","email":"bcomnes@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.9.5","_rev":"3-35541155efdaf1f428e24060f7e253c5","_shasum":"c7b3cfee294061cfba3169089eafd820d69b0aa6","author":{"name":"Bret Comnes"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bcomnes/random-access-http/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"c7b3cfee294061cfba3169089eafd820d69b0aa6","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/random-access-http/-/random-access-http-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"bret","email":"bcomnes@gmail.com"},{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},{"name":"maxogden","email":"max@maxogden.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-20T16:18:41.493Z","created":"2016-06-21T21:31:59.542Z","1.0.0":"2016-06-21T21:31:59.542Z","1.0.1":"2016-06-21T21:37:26.639Z"}}}
