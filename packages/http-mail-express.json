This module resends received messages using SMTP.\r\n\r\nThis module (currently) accepts raw resources (e.g. images or HTML) or url-encoded forms.  Multipart messages/forms are not supported - any external resources should be referenced by URL or sent as separate messages.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar httpMail = require('http-mail-express');\r\n\r\napp.use(httpMail('example.com'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nDocuments POSTed to `/~username` will be emailed to `username@example.com`.  Plain text and HTML are unchanged, images are displayed inline in the email, and anything else is included as an attachment.\r\n\r\nForms (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`) will be interpreted using the same fields as `mailto:` URLs - i.e. fields from RFC 4021 and the [message header registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml), plus the extra \"body\" field for text content.  Typically you'll only use \"to\", \"subject\" and \"body\".\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\napp.use(httpMail('example.com', {\r\n\twebForm: true, /* generates a contact form for GET - provide function for HTML templating function */,\r\n\ttransport: transport /* must support the .sendMail() method from \"nodemailer\" module */\r\n}));\r\n```\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-03-27T21:05:43.879Z","modified":"2015-03-29T00:28:54.596Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"geraintluff","email":"luffgd@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"geraintluff","email":"luffgd@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-mail-express","_nodeVersion":"0.12.1","_npmUser":{"name":"geraintluff","email":"luffgd@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.5.1","_rev":"1-5b09522f945e7c1189906142b320de96","_shasum":"228c83897c6d000fc43e093670b4f9e2e755e72f","author":{"name":"Geraint Luff"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"228c83897c6d000fc43e093670b4f9e2e755e72f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-mail-express/-/http-mail-express-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"geraintluff","email":"luffgd@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-03-29T00:28:54.596Z","created":"2015-03-27T21:05:43.879Z","0.0.0":"2015-03-27T21:05:43.879Z","0.1.0":"2015-03-29T00:28:54.596Z"},"users":{"manikantag":true}}}
