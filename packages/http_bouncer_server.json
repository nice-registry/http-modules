(See: [http_bouncer_client](https://www.npmjs.org/package/http_bouncer_client))\nThere is no queuing or anything. Its only going to broadcasts to any clients that are connected at that time.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Own Server / Development\n\n* `npm install http_bouncer_server`\n* `node node_modules/http_bouncer_server/index.js`\n\n### Heroku\n\n* `heroku create`\n* `heroku labs:enable websockets`\n* `git push heroku master`\n\n## Using\n\n### Setup application to hit created server (see Getting Started)\n\nFormat should be [server]/handler/[channelname]/[regular path]\n\n* *server* - The server running http_bouncer_server (see above)\n* *channelname* - Name of the channel. This is mostly used by the client to figure out where to redirect the given http path\n* *regular path* - Any additional url information to pass to the client\n\n## Example\n\nSetting the scene:\n\n* You have an external service (ex github) that submits webhooks to a specified public url.\n* One or more people want to develop with this data.\n* Your development environment is firewalled of (ex coffeeshop)\n\n### Sending out a sample hit\n\nThis is just demonstrating how to test out. Normally your data would come from another source.\nNote the url, its sending data to the *channelname* of \"gavin\" and the *path* of \"/handler/github?demo=1\"\n\n`curl -d '{ \"zen\" : \"981i34epoqwdu90ads\", \"hook_id\": 12 }' \"http://localhost:3000/handler/gavin/handler/github?demo=1\" --header \"Content-Type:application/json\"`\n\nNote the \"NOLISTENERS\" response\n\n### Setup Client to listen\n\nWe are going use the client to listen to the sample hit. We will talk to the server (-s) of `http://localhost:3000/` and map the channel `gavin` to `http://localhost/dev_application?query_string_to_merge=1`\n\n`http_bouncer_client -s http://localhost:3000/ -c 'gavin:http://localhost/dev_application?query_string_to_merge=1'`\n\nThis will make every hit to the \"gavin\" channel and url of \"handler/github?demo=1\" to hit \"http://localhost/dev_application/handler/github?demo=1&query_string_to_merge=1\"\nSee: [http_bouncer_client](https://www.npmjs.org/package/http_bouncer_client) for more info.\n\n## Release History\n\n0.0.2 - 2014-07-11\n\n* Added documentation and examples\n* Updated dependancies\n\n0.0.1 - 2014-06-17\n\n* Initial Release\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2014 Gavin Mogan\nLicensed under the MIT license.\n\n","created":"2014-06-18T02:58:46.726Z","modified":"2014-07-11T22:15:26.949Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"halkeye","email":"npm@halkeye.net"},"owners":[{"name":"halkeye","email":"npm@halkeye.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http_bouncer_server","_npmUser":{"name":"halkeye","email":"npm@halkeye.net"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.2","_rev":"1-350ab74658d07a0ec4adedfc6a4da942","author":{"name":"Gavin Mogan","email":"gavin@kodekoan.com","url":"http://www.halkeye.net/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/halkeye/http_bouncer_server/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"ee9004a1872bd56238a81589643844093e913706","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http_bouncer_server/-/http_bouncer_server-0.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"halkeye","email":"npm@halkeye.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-07-11T22:15:26.949Z","created":"2014-06-18T02:58:46.726Z","0.0.1":"2014-06-18T02:58:47.453Z","0.0.2":"2014-07-11T22:15:26.949Z"}}}
