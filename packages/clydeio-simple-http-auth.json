It is a required property. Allowed values are `basic` and `digest`.\n* `consumers`: An object with the list of `user` properties and `password` values.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Configured as global prefilter\n\nAll requests are authenticated using basic auth:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"prefilters\" : [\n    {\n      \"id\" : \"basic-auth\",\n      \"path\" : \"clydeio-simple-http-auth\",\n      \"config\" : {\n        \"realm\" : \"clyde\",\n        \"method\" : \"basic\",\n        \"consumers\" : {\n          \"userA\" : \"passwordA\",\n          ...\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Configured as provider prefilter\n\nOnly the requests addresses to the provider are authenticated with digest method:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"providers\" : [\n    {\n      \"id\" : \"some_provider\",\n      \"context\" : \"/some_provider\",\n      \"target\" : \"http://some_server\",\n      \"prefilters\" : [\n        {\n          \"id\" : \"digest-auth\",\n          \"path\" : \"clydeio-simple-http-auth\",\n          \"config\" : {\n            \"realm\" : \"clyde\",\n            \"method\" : \"digest\",\n            \"consumers\" : {\n              \"userA\" : \"passwordA\",\n              ...\n            }\n          }\n        }\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n* It has no sense configure an authentication filter as a global or provider's postfilter.\n\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Antonio Santiago (@acanimal)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
