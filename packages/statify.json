The default is the current working directory.\n\nThe ```-p``` option lets you specify the port that the server will be listening on. It defaults to port 8000.\n\n```-l``` enables simplistic directories listing.\n\nExample: ```statify -d ~/Downloads -p 3000``` will serve your \"Downloads\" directory on port 3000.\n\n","created":"2011-10-11T14:52:18.072Z","modified":"2014-06-03T11:23:08.910Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"lnwdr","email":"leon@lnwdr.de"},"owners":[{"name":"techpriester","email":"techpriester@gmail.com"},{"name":"lnwdr","email":"leon.weidauer@googlemail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"statify","_npmUser":{"name":"lnwdr","email":"leon@lnwdr.de"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.6","_rev":"1-26cef86d0cea5d2bdc2541a058878bc6","author":{"name":"Leon Weidauer","email":"leon@lnwdr.de","url":"http://www.lnwdr.de"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/lnwdr/statify.js/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"da054439df432c0e743ce78ceab187c3e2de171f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/statify/-/statify-2.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"techpriester","email":"techpriester@gmail.com"},{"name":"lnwdr","email":"leon.weidauer@googlemail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.md","time":{"modified":"2014-06-03T11:23:08.910Z","created":"2011-10-11T14:52:18.072Z","1.0.0":"2011-10-11T14:52:18.726Z","1.0.1":"2011-10-11T15:01:28.944Z","1.0.22":"2011-10-12T08:34:33.512Z","1.0.2":"2011-10-12T08:42:46.255Z","1.0.3":"2011-10-12T09:29:47.627Z","1.0.4":"2011-11-16T16:27:56.239Z","1.1.0":"2012-02-26T19:54:28.401Z","2.0.0":"2014-04-04T09:50:43.070Z","2.0.1":"2014-06-03T11:23:08.910Z"}}}
