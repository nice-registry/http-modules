It has a few simple helpers to stringify and parse JSON bodies\nand set several required headers if not present.\n\n### Usage\n\n    var Client = require('simple-request');\n    var c = new Client(); // Default HTTP\n    \n    // For HTTPS, or an other interface that implements the same API:\n    // var HTTPS = require('https');\n    // var c = new Client(HTTPS);\n    \n    // To disable auto-generation of HTTP headers:\n    // var SomeProto = require('some-proto');\n    // var c = new Client(SomeProto, false);\n    \n    c.request({\n        hostname : \"google.com\",\n        port : 80,\n        method : \"GET\",\n        headers : {\n            'x-foo-bar' : \"Hello World\"\n        },\n        path : \"/search?q=define+chunked\"\n    }, function(err, res) {\n        if(err) {\n           console.log(\"Oh No\");\n           return;\n       }\n       \n       console.log(res.data); // The response body is returned in the data attribute\n       // If response header \"Content-Type: application/json[; encoding=...]\" is set,\n       // res.body will contain the parsed object. \n    });\n        \n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2013 John Manero, Dynamic Network Services Inc.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
