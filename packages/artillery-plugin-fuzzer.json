How? MySQL InnoDB engine uses the `latin1` encoding by default.\n\nDid you set the `utf8` encoding on your database? You're still in trouble because those characters are outside the [BMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane) and you need to have specified `utf8mb4` and potentially made changes to your schema to be able to store them properly.\n\nModern software systems are incredibly complex. [If you haven't tried it, assume it's broken](https://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/testing-reliability.html).\n\nHappy fuzzing!\n\n# Roadmap\n\nSending [bnls](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/) payloads is a good start for a fuzzer, but it's only the first small step. We want to make Artillery a great tool for API fuzz testing. Got an idea for this plugin?
