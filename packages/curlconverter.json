The test suite will fail on older versions of node.\n\nIf you want to add new functionality, start with a test. \n\n- Create a file containing the curl command in `fixtures/curl_commands` with a descriptive filename like `post_with_headers.txt`\n- Create a file containing the output in `fixtures/python_output/` with a matching filename (but different extension) like `post_with_headers.py`\n- Run tests with `npm test`.\n- If your filenames match correctly, you should see one failing test. Fix it by modifying the parser in `util.js` or the generators in `generators/`\n\nThe parser generates a generic data structure consumed by code generator functions.\n\nYou can run a specific test with this command:\n\n`node test.js --test=test_name`\n\nwhere \"test_name\" is a file (without extension) in `fixtures/curl_commands`\n\nI recommend setting this up with a debugger so you can see exactly what the parser is passing to the generator.\nHere's my Intellij run configuration for a single test:\n![Screenshot of intellij debug configuration](/docs/intellijconfig.png)\n\nIf you get stuck, please reach out via email. I am always willing to hop on a google hangout and pair program.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Nick Carneiro](http://trillworks.com)\n\n\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/curlconverter\n[npm-image]: https://badge.fury.io/js/curlconverter.svg\n","created":"2014-12-25T05:43:24.261Z","modified":"2017-06-21T05:02:07.946Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"nickc","email":"burthawk101@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"nickc","email":"burthawk101@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"curlconverter","_nodeVersion":"6.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/curlconverter-1.6.0.tgz_1498021327810_0.8109893370419741"},"_npmUser":{"name":"nickc","email":"burthawk101@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"11-1a0de84f2751790160c462a4c796c9fd","_shasum":"bfcf79774aeeaa4d898389f2b5fc02a8699c2570","author":{"name":"Nick Carneiro","email":"nickc@trillworks.com","url":"http://trillworks.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nickcarneiro/curlconverter/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.6.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"bfcf79774aeeaa4d898389f2b5fc02a8699c2570","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/curlconverter/-/curlconverter-1.6.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"nickc","email":"burthawk101@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-21T05:02:07.946Z","created":"2014-12-25T05:43:24.261Z","0.0.0":"2014-12-25T05:43:24.261Z","0.0.1":"2014-12-25T05:47:33.669Z","0.0.2":"2014-12-27T23:32:01.483Z","0.0.3":"2014-12-27T23:38:08.369Z","0.0.4":"2014-12-28T04:30:06.344Z","0.0.5":"2014-12-28T04:32:22.402Z","0.0.7":"2014-12-31T16:25:03.949Z","0.0.8":"2014-12-31T17:29:56.408Z","0.0.9":"2015-01-02T05:16:54.430Z","0.0.10":"2015-01-02T05:22:40.825Z","0.0.11":"2015-01-02T05:42:00.469Z","0.0.12":"2015-01-02T20:29:12.357Z","0.0.13":"2015-01-23T05:56:42.435Z","0.0.14":"2015-08-18T07:14:46.012Z","0.0.15":"2015-11-28T22:39:11.203Z","0.0.16":"2015-12-24T00:46:06.603Z","0.0.17":"2016-01-31T21:32:59.887Z","0.0.18":"2016-02-13T00:04:27.988Z","0.0.19":"2016-02-13T00:25:52.015Z","0.0.20":"2016-02-14T06:04:49.224Z","0.0.21":"2016-02-14T06:41:53.109Z","0.0.22":"2016-03-01T06:49:04.829Z","0.0.23":"2016-03-03T19:26:03.509Z","0.0.24":"2016-03-20T04:03:43.213Z","0.0.25":"2016-03-23T20:48:09.178Z","0.0.26":"2016-09-11T07:29:23.739Z","0.0.27":"2016-10-17T01:06:52.373Z","0.0.28":"2016-10-18T01:06:56.205Z","1.0.0":"2016-10-19T04:29:34.762Z","1.0.1":"2016-10-19T18:34:46.316Z","1.0.2":"2016-10-31T02:16:35.375Z","1.0.3":"2016-10-31T03:24:32.685Z","1.0.4":"2016-10-31T03:52:49.558Z","1.1.0":"2016-12-31T17:30:20.179Z","1.1.1":"2017-01-07T22:10:32.261Z","1.2.0":"2017-02-21T04:02:30.238Z","1.3.0":"2017-03-06T18:11:06.537Z","1.4.0":"2017-03-21T17:22:20.572Z","1.5.0":"2017-04-12T04:03:45.576Z","1.6.0":"2017-06-21T05:02:07.946Z"}}}
