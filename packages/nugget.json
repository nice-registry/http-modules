If the target file exists and is the same size as the remote file, nothing will be done.\n * `-f|--force` - force the server response to be saved to the target file, even if it's a non-successful status code.\n * `-q|--quiet` - disable logging\n * `--no-strict-ssl` - disable strict ssl\n * `--proxy` - specify a proxy to use\n","starsCount":3,"created":"2014-10-18T12:31:53.000Z","modified":"2017-05-14T19:23:53.123Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"maxogden","email":"max@maxogden.com"},{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},{"name":"grncdr","email":"glurgle@gmail.com"},{"name":"jlord","email":"to.jlord@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"nugget","_nodeVersion":"4.4.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/nugget-2.0.1.tgz_1473672259361_0.8369715849403292"},"_npmUser":{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.15.9","_rev":"3-fee392674c1b76c841a172d3bbca04ee","_shasum":"201095a487e1ad36081b3432fa3cada4f8d071b0","author":{"name":"max ogden"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/maxogden/nugget/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.1","1x":"1.6.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"201095a487e1ad36081b3432fa3cada4f8d071b0","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/nugget/-/nugget-2.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"maxogden","email":"max@maxogden.com"},{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},{"name":"grncdr","email":"glurgle@gmail.com"},{"name":"jlord","email":"to.jlord@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-14T19:23:53.123Z","created":"2014-10-18T12:31:53.000Z","1.0.0":"2014-10-18T12:31:53.000Z","1.1.0":"2014-10-20T03:01:52.783Z","1.1.1":"2014-10-20T03:28:53.705Z","1.1.2":"2014-10-20T04:02:50.902Z","1.1.3":"2014-10-20T04:42:39.033Z","1.2.0":"2014-10-21T05:42:22.476Z","1.3.0":"2014-10-21T06:49:04.610Z","1.4.0":"2015-02-03T20:56:59.641Z","1.4.1":"2015-02-03T21:16:58.516Z","1.5.0":"2015-04-14T00:34:36.986Z","1.5.1":"2015-04-14T01:54:14.166Z","1.5.2":"2015-05-14T23:10:47.292Z","1.5.3":"2015-07-26T19:16:43.699Z","1.5.4":"2015-07-27T11:43:15.662Z","1.6.0":"2015-10-13T20:40:19.671Z","1.5.5":"2016-02-10T05:09:29.375Z","1.6.1":"2016-02-10T05:11:24.107Z","2.0.0":"2016-02-10T05:18:04.480Z","1.6.2":"2016-02-10T05:25:33.564Z","2.0.1":"2016-09-12T09:24:21.100Z"},"users":{"ngoldman":true,"supersha":true,"imaginary":true}}}
