This module allows you to\nreduce the traffic and response time by calling a given URL only once at\nany given interval.\n\nIn my tests, http-deduplicate increases the throughput by a 2-5x factor, depending on\nthe application.\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install http-deduplicate -g\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```js\ndeduplicate(url, function (err, data, cb) {\n  // do something async\n  cb()\n  // cb is optional and can be omitted\n})\n```\n\nSee [example.js](./example.js) for a full example\n\n## API\n\n### deduplicate(address, callback(err, data [, cb]))\n\nCalls `address` (as defined in[http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_get_options_callback) and\n[https](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_get_options_callback) only once in a given period, all the other requests will receive the same data.\n\nFor extreme optimizations in high load scenarios, you can serve the\nlatest returned value up until all `callback` (if present) are\ncalled.\n\n## TODO\n\n* [Â ] HTTP headers\n* [ ] HTTP caching (ETag)\n* [ ] HTTP caching (Last-Modified)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nhttp-deduplicate is sponsored by [nearForm](http://nearform.com).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","created":"2016-02-04T13:42:55.237Z","modified":"2016-02-06T11:57:48.446Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"matteo.collina","email":"hello@matteocollina.com"},"owners":[{"name":"matteo.collina","email":"hello@matteocollina.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-deduplicate","_nodeVersion":"4.2.4","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-5-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http-deduplicate-0.1.2.tgz_1454759867304_0.5248227808624506"},"_npmUser":{"name":"matteo.collina","email":"hello@matteocollina.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.12","_rev":"1-8fec544b896ec96563bfc616f307674e","_shasum":"2d0287f22425bd39031cd9809a7e86dc8c073874","author":{"name":"Matteo Collina","email":"hello@matteocollina.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mcollina/http-deduplicate/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"2d0287f22425bd39031cd9809a7e86dc8c073874","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-deduplicate/-/http-deduplicate-0.1.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"matteo.collina","email":"hello@matteocollina.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-02-06T11:57:48.446Z","created":"2016-02-04T13:42:55.237Z","0.0.1":"2016-02-04T13:42:55.237Z","0.1.0":"2016-02-05T15:14:24.720Z","0.1.1":"2016-02-05T16:28:39.320Z","0.1.2":"2016-02-06T11:57:48.446Z"}}}
