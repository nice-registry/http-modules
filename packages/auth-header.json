Noteably, this library is less strict than it could be to parse some of these legacy formats.\n\nIn addition to the format of the header itself being in flux, WWW-Authenticate has its own nasty surprise: sometimes multiple authentication prompts can appear in one header, sometimes they can appear in multiple headers; we _ONLY_ support the latter case since trying to disambiguate between a second prompt and parameters for the first is just about impossible.\n\n```javascript\nimport * as authorization from 'auth-header';\nimport express from 'express';\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n\n\t// Something messed up.\n\tfunction fail() {\n\t\tres.set('WWW-Authenticate', authorization.format('Basic'));\n\t\tres.status(401).send();\n\t}\n\n\t// Get authorization header.\n\tvar auth = authorization.parse(req.get('authorization'));\n\n\t// No basic authentication provided.\n\tif (auth.scheme !== 'Basic') {\n\t\treturn fail();\n\t}\n\n\t// Get the basic auth component.\n\tvar [un, pw] = Buffer(auth.token, 'base64').toString().split(':', 2);\n\n\t// Verify authentication.\n\tif (pw !== 'admin') {\n\t\treturn fail();\n\t}\n\n\t// We've reached the promise land.\n\tres.send('Hello world.');\n});\n```\n\n[RFC7235]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235\n[express-authentication-header]: https://github.com/izaakschroeder/express-authentication-header\n","starsCount":3,"created":"2014-12-02T09:51:30.220Z","modified":"2017-04-10T16:21:10.886Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"izaakschroeder","email":"izaak.schroeder@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"izaakschroeder","email":"izaak.schroeder@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"auth-header","_nodeVersion":"5.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/auth-header-0.3.1.tgz_1461346994282_0.46169076045043766"},"_npmUser":{"name":"izaakschroeder","email":"izaak.schroeder@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.7.3","_rev":"2-3009faccd3d1702994f144066b678b28","_shasum":"44007ed69644cc9eab068ec4c8c495deee64697f","author":{"name":"Izaak Schroeder","email":"izaak.schroeder@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/izaakschroeder/auth-header/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"44007ed69644cc9eab068ec4c8c495deee64697f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/auth-header/-/auth-header-0.3.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"izaakschroeder","email":"izaak.schroeder@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-10T16:21:10.886Z","created":"2014-12-02T09:51:30.220Z","0.1.0":"2014-12-02T09:51:30.220Z","0.1.1":"2014-12-15T02:23:50.122Z","0.2.0":"2015-01-06T23:59:04.089Z","0.2.1":"2015-01-07T09:09:07.467Z","0.2.2":"2015-01-08T05:21:53.708Z","0.3.0":"2016-01-30T11:19:35.629Z","0.3.1":"2016-04-22T17:43:16.613Z"},"users":{"r3nya":true,"456wyc":true,"leonardorb":true}}}
