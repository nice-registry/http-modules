The generator function requires a [bole logger](https://www.npmjs.com/packages/bole) and a [LevelUp-compatible data store](https://www.npmjs.com/packages/levelup).\n\nThe server responds to endpoints for a number of purposes:\n\n1. Store and serve Common Forms.\n2. List Common Forms stored by digest.\n3. Register HTTP POST callbacks for notification of new Common Forms.\n4. Serve metadata about the service and its version.\n","created":"2015-05-25T06:41:11.993Z","modified":"2016-01-18T04:10:13.682Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"kemitchell","email":"kyle@kemitchell.com"},"owners":[{"name":"kemitchell","email":"kyle@kemitchell.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"commonform-serve","_nodeVersion":"5.3.0","_npmUser":{"name":"kemitchell","email":"kyle@kemitchell.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.5.3","_rev":"1-e6bc0723b52c8e6aab41591ecb86b6aa","_shasum":"f3bfaaf5e06708945a3104776e3260b71df63fd7","author":{"name":"Kyle E.
