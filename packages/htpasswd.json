This option should be used with extreme care, since the password is clearly visible on the command line. For script use see the -i option.\n - `-i` - Read the password from stdin without verification (for script usage).\n - `-c` - Create a new file.\n - `-n` - Don't update file; display results on stdout.\n - `-m` - Use MD5 encryption for passwords. This is the default.\n - `-B` - Use bcrypt encryption for passwords. This is currently considered to be very secure.\n - `-C` - This flag is only allowed in combination with -B (bcrypt encryption). It sets the computing time used for the bcrypt algorithm (higher is more secure but slower, default: 5, valid: 4 to 31).\n - `-d` - Use crypt() encryption for passwords. This algorithm limits the password length to 8 characters. This algorithm is insecure by today's standards.\n - `-s` - Use SHA encryption for passwords. This algorithm is insecure by today's standards.\n - `-p` - Do not encrypt the password (plaintext).\n - `-D` - Delete the specified user.\n - `-v` - Verify password. Verify that the given password matches the password of the user stored in the specified htpasswd file.\n\n## Running tests\n\nIt uses [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), so just run following command in package directory:\n\n```bash\n$ npm test\n```\n\n## Issues\n\nYou can find list of issues using **[this link](http://github.com/http-auth/htpasswd/issues)**.\n\n## Requirements\n\n - **[Node.js](http://nodejs.org)** - Event-driven I/O server-side JavaScript       environment based on V8.\n - **[npm](http://npmjs.org)** - Package manager. Installs, publishes and manages   node programs.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n - **[commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js/)** - node.js command-line interfaces made easy.\n - **[prompt](https://github.com/flatiron/prompt)** - a beautiful command-line prompt for node.js.\n - **[apache-md5](https://github.com/http-auth/apache-md5)** - Node.js module for Apache style password encryption using md5.\n - **[apache-crypt](https://github.com/http-auth/apache-crypt)** - Node.js module for Apache style password encryption using crypt(3).\n - **[bcrypt.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js)** - Optimized bcrypt in plain JavaScript with zero dependencies.\n\n## Development dependencies\n\n - **[mocha](https://mochajs.org/)** - simple, flexible, fun javascript test framework for node.js & the browser.\n - **[chai](http://chaijs.com/)** - BDD / TDD assertion framework for node.js and the browser that can be paired with any testing framework.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Gevorg Harutyunyan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
