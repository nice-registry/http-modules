Let's be bad guys.\");\n});\n\nbdh.listen(3000);\n```\nBDH starts a server and listens on port 3000 for connections. This app will respond with an inspirational Firefly quote for requests to the root URL (/), and with Jayne's famous one-liner for GET requests to our `/serenity` path. For every other path, it will respond with a default __404: Not Found__ message.\n\n> Note that the `req` (request) and `res` (response) objects are the same ones that Node provides, so you can use them as you normally would without BDH involved.\n\nRun your app with the following command:\n```\n$ node bdh.js\n```\nThen load <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to see it in action. That's it! That's all it takes to get a simple server up and running with BDH.\n\n## Routing\nRoute definition takes the following structure:\n```\nbdh.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)\n```\nWhere:\n * __bdh__ is an instance of BDH.\n * __METHOD__ is an [HTTP request method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE only).\n * __PATH__ is a path on the server (valid string only).\n * __HANDLER__ is the function that is executed when the route is matched.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to define some simple routes:\n\nRespond with a customized message on the homepage:\n```javascript\nbdh.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  res.send(\"I aim to misbehave.\");\n});\n```\nRespond to a POST request on the `/jayne` route:\n```javascript\nbdh.post(\"/jayne\", (req, res) => {\n  res.send(\"I'll be in my bunk.\");\n});\n```\nRespond to a DELETE request on the `/wash` route:\n```javascript\nbdh.delete(\"/wash\", (req, res) => {\n  res.send(\"I'm a leaf on the wind.\");\n});\n```\n\n## API\n\n### Application\nCreate an instance of the BDH framework:\n```javascript\nconst bdh = require(\"big-damn-heroes\");\n```\n\n#### bdh.get(path, callback)\nRoutes HTTP GET requests to the specified path with the provided callback function.\n```javascript\nbdh.get(\"/kaylee\", (req, res) => {\n  res.send(\"To hell with this! I'm gonna live!\");\n});\n```\n\n#### bdh.post(path, callback)\nRoutes HTTP POST requests to the specified path with the provided callback function.\n\n#### bdh.put(path, callback)\nRoutes HTTP PUT requests to the specified path with the provided callback function.\n\n#### bdh.patch(path, callback)\nRoutes HTTP PATCH requests to the specified path with the provided callback function.\n\n#### bdh.delete(path, callback)\nRoutes HTTP DELETE requests to the specified path with the provided callback function.\n\n#### bdh.badRoute(callback)\nOverrides the default __404: Not Found__ behavior when a callback function is provided:\n```javascript\nbdh.badRoute((req, res) => {\n  res.send(\"Best be on your merry.\");\n});\n```\n\n#### bdh.listen(port[, callback])\nReturns an instance of an HTTP server and starts it using the indicated port. It also prints a poignant message with the port information to the console, but this default behavior can be overridden by providing an optional callback function:\n```javascript\nbdh.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log(\"I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.\");\n});\n```\n\n### Response\nThe `res` object represents the HTTP response that BDH sends when it receives an HTTP request.\n\n#### res.send([body])\nSends a simple HTTP response.\n\nThe `body` parameter can be a `String`, an object, an `Array`, or a `Buffer` object representing a string. It automatically sets the `Content-Type` header field based on the input, sets the appropriate status code, and ends the response. Objects and arrays are automatically JSON serialized. If no `body` parameter is supplied, an empty string will be written to the response.\n","created":"2016-04-18T19:52:11.714Z","modified":"2016-04-21T08:42:04.551Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"hollislau","email":"hollislau@hotmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"hollislau","email":"hollislau@hotmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"big-damn-heroes","_nodeVersion":"4.4.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/big-damn-heroes-1.0.0.tgz_1461228122097_0.9796867482364178"},"_npmUser":{"name":"hollislau","email":"hollislau@hotmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.20","_rev":"1-36f8f599995e503a5496fcab7fd16032","_shasum":"1a70e702ed2af7fbdd1f47d5523e80fe00070235","author":{"name":"Hollis Lau","email":"hollislau@hotmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hollislau/big-damn-heroes/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"1a70e702ed2af7fbdd1f47d5523e80fe00070235","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/big-damn-heroes/-/big-damn-heroes-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"hollislau","email":"hollislau@hotmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-04-21T08:42:04.551Z","created":"2016-04-18T19:52:11.714Z","0.1.0":"2016-04-18T19:52:11.714Z","1.0.0":"2016-04-21T08:42:04.551Z"}}}
