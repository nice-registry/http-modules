super-simplified web framework inspired by [Express](http://expressjs.com/) for those cases when you don't need templates, render engines and all the fancy stuff.\nA combination of a router, a middleware chain and a bunch of response helper utilities. Not more, not less. \n\n## Usage\n\n```js\n\nvar ellipse = require('ellipse'),\n    app     = ellipse()\n\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n    var name = req.query.name || 'Ellipse'\n\n    res.send('Welcome ' + name + '!')\n})\n\napp.get('/:name', function (req, res) {\n    res.html('<h1>Hello ' + req.params.name + '!</h1>')\n})\n\napp.get('/:greeting/:name', function (req, res) {\n    res.json({\n        status: 'success',\n        data: {\n            greeting: req.params.greeting,\n            name:     req.params.name\n        }\n    })\n})\n\napp.listen(3333, function () {\n    console.log('server is ready to accept connections on port 3333')\n})\n\n```\n\nFor more information, see the [examples](https://github.com/schwarzkopfb/ellipse/blob/master/examples). \n\n## Installation\n\nWith npm:\n\n    npm install --save ellipse\n    \nWith git:\n    \n    git clone git://github.com/schwarzkopfb/ellipse.git\n\n## License\n\n[MIT
