Run `npm install -g parody` to install the command-line tool\n2. Move to your working directory\n3. Create a `parody.json` file that has at least the following directives\n\n```json\n{\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"header_one\": \"value_one\",\n    \"header_two\": \"value_two\"\n  },\n  \"target\": \"http://some-awesome-hostname:8080\",\n  \"debug\": false,\n  \"port\": 8080\n}\n```\n\nThis will add the following HTTP headers to the request:\n\n```\n\"header_one\" = value_one\n\"header_two\" = value_two\n```\n\n4. Run `parody` in your working directory to start a proxy server\n5. Access `http://localhost:$PORT` (where `$PORT` is your configured port in\n  `parody.json`, or a default of `8080`)\n\n## Report issues!\n\nIf you encounter anything strange while using parody, make an issue, or [ask me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/brandon_mn).\n\n## Incoming improvements\n\n- expanded documentation\n- revamped debug mode\n- HTTPS support\n\n## See also:\n\nParody uses [Node HTTP Proxy](http://npmjs.com/http-proxy) to add headers\nto HTTP requests. If you're looking to programmatically proxy things, check\nout that project.\n","created":"2015-12-22T22:49:39.371Z","modified":"2015-12-22T22:49:39.371Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"brandon_mn","email":"b@johnsonmn.org"},"owners":[{"name":"brandon_mn","email":"b@johnsonmn.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"parody","_nodeVersion":"4.1.1","_npmUser":{"name":"brandon_mn","email":"b@johnsonmn.org"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.4","_rev":"1-d70b759a994024aa2470e1919353ad4d","_shasum":"4fb6ed88ab9448e107ae3317c9efe8dad7e5fc13","author":{"name":"Brandon Johnson","email":"b@johnsonmn.org"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/skylineproject/parody/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"4fb6ed88ab9448e107ae3317c9efe8dad7e5fc13","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/parody/-/parody-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"brandon_mn","email":"b@johnsonmn.org"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-12-22T22:49:39.371Z","created":"2015-12-22T22:49:39.371Z","1.0.1":"2015-12-22T22:49:39.371Z"}}}
