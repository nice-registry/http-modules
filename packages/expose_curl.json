For any requests browser did, you can copy the request in the form of curl command, paste it into the terminal, and basically replay the request. I wanted to have the same thing in console node.js applications, so here it is.\n\nFair warnings:\n - this tool will print out anything including private data such as auth tokens\n - it is not a security tool, so it's quite possible to write code that does http request bypassing it\n\n","created":"2014-06-26T05:08:16.234Z","modified":"2014-07-22T16:37:24.919Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"rlidwka","email":"alex@kocharin.ru"},"owners":[{"name":"rlidwka","email":"alex@kocharin.ru"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"expose_curl","_npmUser":{"name":"rlidwka","email":"alex@kocharin.ru"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.0","_rev":"1-ed95d65cbe31f5aa94840e19b6749e4b","_shasum":"ee6f164edf70754a81ca1813092b40c904c82dac","author":{"name":"Alex Kocharin","email":"alex@kocharin.ru"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/rlidwka/expose_curl/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"ee6f164edf70754a81ca1813092b40c904c82dac","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/expose_curl/-/expose_curl-0.3.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"rlidwka","email":"alex@kocharin.ru"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-07-22T16:37:24.919Z","created":"2014-06-26T05:08:16.234Z","0.1.0":"2014-06-26T05:08:16.234Z","0.2.0":"2014-07-21T16:24:40.298Z","0.3.0":"2014-07-22T16:37:24.919Z"}}}
