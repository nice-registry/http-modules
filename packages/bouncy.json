Do this if you want to make an https router.\n\nIf the arity of `cb` is 3, you'll get the response object `res` in\n`cb(req, res, bounce)`.\nOtherwise you just get `cb(req, bounce)`.\n\nIf you are using more than one SSL cert, add `opts.SNICallback`.\nSee the example http-https-sni.js and the\n[nodejs tls page](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_createserver_options_secureconnectionlistener)\nfor details.\n\n## bounce(stream, opts={})\n\nCall this function when you're ready to bounce the request to a stream.\n\nThe exact request that was received will be written to `stream` and future\nincoming data will be piped to and from it.\n\nTo send data to a different url path on the destination stream, you can specify\n`opts.path`.\n\nTo change the http verb you can set `opts.method`.\n\nYou can specify header fields to insert into the request with `opts.headers`.\n\n`bounce()` returns the stream object that it uses to connect to the remote host.\n\n## bounce(port, ...), bounce(host, port, ...), bounce(url)\n\nThese variants of `bounce()` are sugar for\n`bounce(net.connect(port))` and `bounce(net.connect(port, host))`.\n\nOptionally you can pass port and host keys to `opts` and it does the same thing.\n\nPassing `bounce()` a string that looks like a url (with or without `\"http://\"`)\nwill set the opts.host, opts.port, and opts.path accordingly.\n\n# usage\n\n```\nusage: bouncy FILE PORT\n\nCreate a routes FILE like this:\n\n  {\n    \"beep.example.com\" : 8000,\n    \"boop.example.com\" : 8001\n  }\n\nThen point the `bouncy` command at this `routes.json` file and give it\na port to listen on: \n\n  bouncy routes.json 80\n\nThe `routes.json` file should just map host names to host/port combos. Use a\ncolon-separated string to specify a host and port in a route.\n\nUse `\"\"` for the host as a default route.\n\nYou can optionally specify a listen address as the third parameter or with\n`--address`. It defaults to `0.0.0.0`. Specify `::` to listen on both IPv4 and\nIPv6 addresses.\n```\n\n# install\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org), to get the library do:\n\n```\nnpm install bouncy\n```\n\nor to install the command-line tool do:\n\n```\nnpm install -g bouncy\n```\n\n# license\n\nMIT\n","starsCount":14,"created":"2011-10-10T08:29:28.704Z","modified":"2017-02-21T16:21:02.292Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"substack","email":"mail@substack.net"},"owners":[{"name":"substack","email":"mail@substack.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"bouncy","_nodeVersion":"0.10.31","_npmUser":{"name":"substack","email":"mail@substack.net"},"_npmVersion":"2.0.2","_rev":"3-41f3dac3fb6cbe32fdcdf26d20bb9c73","_shasum":"82ab4ad7beae05890eed54b9af3c45394b185dc7","author":{"name":"James Halliday","email":"mail@substack.net","url":"http://substack.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/substack/bouncy/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"3.2.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"82ab4ad7beae05890eed54b9af3c45394b185dc7","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/bouncy/-/bouncy-3.2.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"substack","email":"mail@substack.net"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.markdown","time":{"modified":"2017-02-21T16:21:02.292Z","created":"2011-10-10T08:29:28.704Z","0.0.0":"2011-10-10T08:29:30.346Z","0.0.1":"2011-10-10T10:36:18.231Z","0.0.2":"2011-10-10T11:47:59.727Z","0.0.3":"2011-10-10T12:05:00.484Z","0.0.4":"2011-10-10T12:32:44.115Z","0.0.5":"2011-10-10T13:34:28.983Z","0.1.0":"2011-10-10T22:37:02.869Z","0.1.1":"2011-10-10T22:53:03.996Z","0.2.0":"2011-10-11T01:52:02.957Z","0.2.1":"2011-10-11T06:16:13.525Z","0.3.0":"2011-10-11T07:13:34.668Z","0.3.1":"2011-10-11T22:56:36.874Z","1.0.0":"2011-10-24T04:47:14.872Z","1.0.1":"2011-10-24T22:15:28.882Z","1.0.2":"2011-10-24T23:33:51.335Z","1.0.3":"2011-11-30T14:22:06.477Z","1.0.4":"2011-11-30T20:05:56.692Z","1.0.5":"2011-12-05T19:59:18.354Z","1.0.6":"2012-01-12T07:55:47.179Z","1.0.8":"2012-01-15T08:04:11.566Z","1.1.0":"2012-01-15T08:35:25.675Z","1.1.1":"2012-02-02T21:40:27.386Z","1.2.0":"2012-02-13T01:58:44.660Z","1.3.0":"2012-02-13T02:59:48.917Z","1.3.1":"2012-02-13T03:10:14.430Z","2.0.0":"2012-12-15T11:21:22.881Z","2.0.1":"2012-12-17T03:52:15.675Z","2.0.2":"2012-12-17T21:48:26.665Z","2.0.3":"2012-12-19T04:48:16.396Z","2.1.0":"2013-03-19T06:26:50.486Z","3.0.0":"2013-03-22T08:16:41.074Z","3.0.1":"2013-03-22T09:27:45.932Z","3.1.0":"2013-03-22T10:14:28.760Z","3.1.1":"2013-04-13T10:19:32.657Z","3.1.2":"2013-05-26T07:23:29.491Z","3.2.0":"2013-07-21T02:17:44.318Z","3.2.1":"2013-09-24T05:21:20.610Z","3.2.2":"2014-10-09T05:53:06.872Z"},"users":{"fgribreau":true,"pid":true,"hij1nx":true,"nrn":true,"leesei":true,"gustavohenke":true,"joshgillies":true,"roshanravi10":true,"zeusdeux":true,"akiva":true,"sedmonds":true,"nichoth":true,"django_wong":true,"gwilison":true}}}
