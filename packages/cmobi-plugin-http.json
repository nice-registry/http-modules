Supports iOS and Android.\n\n## Advantages over Javascript requests\n\n - Background threading - all requests are done in a background thread.\n - SSL Pinning - read more at [LumberBlog](http://blog.lumberlabs.com/2012/04/why-app-developers-should-care-about.html).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe plugin conforms to the Cordova plugin specification, it can be installed\nusing the Cordova / Phonegap command line interface.\n\n    phonegap plugin add https://github.com/wymsee/cordova-HTTP.git\n\n    cordova plugin add https://github.com/wymsee/cordova-HTTP.git\n\n## Usage\n\n### AngularJS\n\nThis plugin creates a cordovaHTTP service inside of a cordovaHTTP module.  You must load the module when you create your app's module.\n\n    var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute', 'ngAnimate', 'cordovaHTTP']);\n    \nYou can then inject the cordovaHTTP service into your controllers.  The functions can then be used identically to the examples shown below except that instead of accepting success and failure callback functions, each function returns a promise.  For more information on promises in AngularJS read the [AngularJS docs](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q).  For more info on promises in general check out this article on [html5rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/).  Make sure that you load cordova.js or phonegap.js after AngularJS is loaded.\n\n### Not AngularJS\n\nThis plugin registers a `cordovaHTTP` global on window\n\n\n## Functions\n\nAll available functions are documented below.  Every function takes a success and error callback function as the last 2 arguments.\n\n### useBasicAuth\nThis sets up all future requests to use Basic HTTP authentication with the given username and password.\n\n    cordovaHTTP.useBasicAuth(\"user\", \"password\", function() {\n        console.log('success!');\n    }, function() {\n        console.log('error :(');\n    });\n    \n### setHeader\nSet a header for all future requests.  Takes a header and a value.\n\n    cordovaHTTP.setHeader(\"Header\", \"Value\", function() {\n        console.log('success!');\n    }, function() {\n        console.log('error :(');\n    });\n\n### enableSSLPinning\nEnable or disable SSL pinning.  To use SSL pinning you must include at least one .cer SSL certificate in your app project.  You can pin to your server certificate or to one of the issuing CA certificates. For ios include your certificate in the root level of your bundle (just add the .cer file to your project/target at the root level).  For android include your certificate in your project's platforms/android/assets folder.  In both cases all .cer files found will be loaded automatically.  If you only have a .pem certificate see this [stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16583429/3182729).  You want to convert it to a DER encoded certificate with a .cer extension.\n\nAs an alternative, you can store your .cer files in the www/certificates folder.\n\n    cordovaHTTP.enableSSLPinning(true, function() {\n        console.log('success!');\n    }, function() {\n        console.log('error :(');\n    });\n    \n### acceptAllCerts\nAccept all SSL certificates.  Or disable accepting all certificates.\n\n    cordovaHTTP.acceptAllCerts(true, function() {\n        console.log('success!');\n    }, function() {\n        console.log('error :(');\n    });\n    \n### post<a name=\"post\"></a>\nExecute a POST request.  Takes a URL, parameters, and headers.\n\n#### success\nThe success function receives a response object with 2 properties: status and data.  Status is the HTTP response code and data is the response from the server as a string. Here's a quick example:\n\n    {\n        status: 200,\n        data: \"{'id': 12, 'message': 'test'}\"\n    }\n    \nMost apis will return JSON meaning you'll want to parse the data like in the example below:\n\n    cordovaHTTP.post(\"https://google.com/\", {\n        id: 12,\n        message: \"test\"\n    }, { Authorization: \"OAuth2: token\" }, function(response) {\n        // prints 200\n        console.log(response.status);\n        try {\n            response.data = JSON.parse(response.data);\n            // prints test\n            console.log(response.data.message);\n        } catch(e) {\n            console.error(\"JSON parsing error\");\n        }\n    }, function(response) {\n        // prints 403\n        console.log(response.status);\n        \n        //prints Permission denied \n        console.log(response.error);\n    });\n    \n    \n#### failure\nThe error function receives a response object with 2 properties: status and error.  Status is the HTTP response code.  Error is the error response from the server as a string.  Here's a quick example:\n\n    {\n        status: 403,\n        error: \"Permission denied\"\n    }\n    \n### get\nExecute a GET request.  Takes a URL, parameters, and headers.  See the [post](#post) documentation for details on what is returned on success and failure.\n\n    cordovaHTTP.get(\"https://google.com/\", {\n        id: 12,\n        message: \"test\"\n    }, { Authorization: \"OAuth2: token\" }, function(response) {\n        console.log(response.status);\n    }, function(response) {\n        console.error(response.error);\n    });\n    \n### uploadFile\nUploads a file saved on the device.  Takes a URL, parameters, headers, filePath, and the name of the parameter to pass the file along as.  See the [post](#post) documentation for details on what is returned on success and failure.\n\n    cordovaHTTP.uploadFile(\"https://google.com/\", {\n        id: 12,\n        message: \"test\"\n    }, { Authorization: \"OAuth2: token\" }, \"file:///somepicture.jpg\", \"picture\", function(response) {\n        console.log(response.status);\n    }, function(response) {\n        console.error(response.error);\n    });\n    \n### downloadFile\nDownloads a file and saves it to the device.  Takes a URL, parameters, headers, and a filePath.  See [post](#post) documentation for details on what is returned on failure.  On success this function returns a cordova [FileEntry object](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.3.0/cordova_file_file.md.html#FileEntry).\n\n    cordovaHTTP.downloadFile(\"https://google.com/\", {\n        id: 12,\n        message: \"test\"\n    }, { Authorization: \"OAuth2: token\" }, \"file:///somepicture.jpg\", function(entry) {\n        // prints the filename\n        console.log(entry.name);\n        \n        // prints the filePath\n        console.log(entry.fullPath);\n    }, function(response) {\n        console.error(response.error);\n    });\n\n\n## Libraries\n\nThis plugin utilizes some awesome open source networking libraries.  These are both MIT licensed:\n\n - iOS - [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)\n - Android - [http-request](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/http-request)\n\nWe made a few modifications to http-request.  They can be found in a separate repo here: https://github.com/wymsee/http-request\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis plugin isn't equivalent to using XMLHttpRequest or Ajax calls in Javascript.\nFor instance, the following features are currently not supported:\n\n- cookies support (a cookie set by a request isn't sent in subsequent requests)\n- read content of error responses (only the HTTP status code and message are returned)\n- read returned HTTP headers (e.g. in case security tokens are returned as headers)\n\nTake this into account when using this plugin into your application.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Wymsee, Inc\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
