No HTTP server, no ports or sockets. Just your code in the same execution pipeline you are already familiar with.\n\nBefore using this module, you should already understand API Gateway and AWS Lambda. Specifically, you *must* be using Proxy Integration.\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use `express` (or `connect` or any `req, res` type middleware) instead of `koa` - it's all the same:\n\n```javascript\nconst serverless = require('serverless-http');\nconst koa = require('koa');\n\n// construct your app as normal\nconst app = koa();\n// register your middleware as normal\napp.use(/* ... */);\n\n// this is it!\nmodule.exports.handler = serverless(app);\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\nYour code is still running in Lambda and API Gateway. This means you are still subject to the file size restrictions, for example. You also cannot rely on your server being 'up' in the sense that you can/should not use in-memory sessions, web sockets, etc.\n\n>Think of this as a familiar way of expressing your API, *not* trying to make Lambda do something it cannot.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcome! Especially test scenarios for different situations (e.g. multipart)\n\n## Further Reading\n\nHere are some [more detailed examples](./docs/EXAMPLES.md) and [advanced configuration options](./docs/ADVANCED.md)\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2016-10-07T23:29:14.018Z","modified":"2017-05-06T03:19:41.714Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"dougmoscrop","email":"doug.moscrop@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"dmoscrop","email":"doug.moscrop@gmail.com"},{"name":"dougmoscrop","email":"doug.moscrop@gmail.com"},{"name":"microservice-admin","email":"doug.moscrop@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"serverless-http","_nodeVersion":"6.10.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/serverless-http-1.4.3.tgz_1494032269396_0.8912134701386094"},"_npmUser":{"name":"dougmoscrop","email":"doug.moscrop@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"18-0b0682c7412cdc973ceef721df218566","_shasum":"9796995c2e6c52f9656f9c15671801a2a910ce45","author":{"name":"Doug Moscrop","email":"doug.moscrop@gmail.com","url":"http://www.github.com/dougmoscrop"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dougmoscrop/serverless-http/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Doug Moscrop","email":"doug.moscrop@gmail.com","url":"https://github.com/dougmoscrop"},{"name":"Roch Devost","url":"https://github.com/rochdev"},{"name":"Bryan Gamble","url":"https://github.com/bdgamble"},{"name":"Derek MacDonald","url":"https://github.com/demacdonald"},{"name":"Filip Skokan","email":"panva.ip@gmail.com","url":"https://github.com/panva"},{"name":"Kevin Tonon","email":"kevin@betweenconcepts.com","url":"https://github.com/ktonon"},{"name":"Tamás Máhr","url":"https://github.com/tamasmahr"}],"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.4.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"9796995c2e6c52f9656f9c15671801a2a910ce45","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/serverless-http/-/serverless-http-1.4.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"dmoscrop","email":"doug.moscrop@gmail.com"},{"name":"dougmoscrop","email":"doug.moscrop@gmail.com"},{"name":"microservice-admin","email":"doug.moscrop@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-06T03:19:41.714Z","created":"2016-10-07T23:29:14.018Z","1.0.0":"2016-10-07T23:29:14.018Z","1.0.1":"2016-10-08T00:44:12.948Z","1.0.2":"2016-11-03T17:46:32.744Z","1.0.3":"2016-12-04T01:28:48.867Z","1.0.4":"2016-12-04T01:33:17.746Z","1.0.5":"2016-12-06T15:55:08.494Z","1.0.6":"2016-12-07T17:00:53.381Z","1.1.0":"2016-12-19T20:58:19.151Z","1.2.0":"2017-01-09T18:40:01.939Z","1.3.0":"2017-01-30T23:44:04.221Z","1.4.0":"2017-02-06T19:35:37.334Z","1.4.1":"2017-02-07T16:59:27.794Z","1.4.2":"2017-02-11T01:48:39.676Z","1.4.3":"2017-05-06T00:57:51.375Z"},"users":{"diglididudeng":true,"evan-king":true}}}
