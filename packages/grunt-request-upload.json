Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-request-upload --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-request-upload');\n```\n\n## The \"request_upload\" task\n\n### Overview\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `request_upload` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n\n  request_upload: {\n    your_target: {\n      options: {\n\t\t\tmethod: 'POST',\n\t\t\turl: '',\n\t\t\theaders: {},\n\t\t\tdata: {},\t\t\t\n\t\t\tonProgress: function (percent, uploaded, total) {},\n\t\t\tonComplete: function (data) {},\n\t\t\tsrc: ''\n\t\t},\n    },\n  },\n\n})\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### options.method\nType: `String` Default value: 'POST'\nDefault value: `POST`\n\nThe HTTP method to use to upload the file. Look in the API documentation you want to use, this is usually POST or PUT.\n\n#### options.url\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `''`\n\nThis is the full URL to which you can upload a file.\nYou can append some variables, like an API token.\n\n\n#### options.data\nType: `Object`\nDefault value: `{}`\n\nAny form data fields to be sent in addition to the file upload\n\n#### options.headers\nType: `Object`\nDefaultValue: `{}`\n\nHeaders to send along with your HTTP request. For example, a lot of API require the Authentication to be sent through the Headers.\n\n#### options.onProgress\nType: `Function`\nDefaultValue: `function(percent, uploaded, total) {}`\n\nCallback used to uploaded progress.\n\n#### options.onComplete\nType: `Function`\nDefaultValue: `function(data) {}`\n\nCallback used to process server's response. For example, when server returns id of uploaded file you need to process afterwards.\n\n#### src\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `''`\n\nThe local path of the file you wish to upload, using the current working directory as a reference.\nYou can upload only 1 file at a time.","created":"2015-10-25T07:11:31.217Z","modified":"2015-10-28T14:26:44.949Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"xzf158","email":"terry.xu@me.com"},"owners":[{"name":"xzf158","email":"terry.xu@me.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"grunt-request-upload","_nodeVersion":"4.2.1","_npmUser":{"name":"xzf158","email":"terry.xu@me.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.7","_rev":"1-14b8adae1ad10fb3e2d374d3321c5183","_shasum":"9b395bdd04bdaf54e2b66c7cbbb7b75eefe619e6","author":{"name":"Terry Xu","url":"http://tblog.im"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/xzf158/grunt-request-upload/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"9b395bdd04bdaf54e2b66c7cbbb7b75eefe619e6","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-request-upload/-/grunt-request-upload-0.1.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"xzf158","email":"terry.xu@me.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-10-28T14:26:44.949Z","created":"2015-10-25T07:11:31.217Z","0.1.0":"2015-10-25T07:11:31.217Z","0.1.1":"2015-10-25T07:21:35.069Z","0.1.2":"2015-10-25T07:27:22.769Z","0.1.3":"2015-10-25T07:36:10.210Z","0.1.4":"2015-10-25T11:46:21.893Z","0.1.5":"2015-10-25T11:59:46.713Z","0.1.6":"2015-10-28T14:26:44.949Z"}}}
