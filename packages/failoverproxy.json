A backend can be just an URL, the string 'cache' or an object containing `host` and `port`. Some examples:\n\n\t{\n\t    host: '127.0.0.1',\n\t    port: 8087\n\t}\n\n\t'http://127.0.0.1:8087/'\n\n\t'cache'\n\n\nThe backend object supports the following properties:\n\n* `type`   - Backend type (`server` or `cache`). Defaults to `server` when a `host` is specified. Defaults to `cache` when a `path` is specified;\n\nThe server backends (`type: \"server`) support the following properties:\n\n* `proto`  - Backend protocol (http or https);\n* `host`   - The backend hostname;\n* `port`   - The backend port; Defaults to `80`;\n* `prefix` - The URL prefix to be used on the backend;\n\nThe cache backends (`type: \"cache\"`) support the following properties:\n\n* `driver` - The cache driver to be used. Defaults to `fs`, the only cache driver shipped with failoverproxy;\n* `expireTime`  - The number of milliseconds that a cache item takes to expire. Supports numbers or the string `never`;\n\nThe `fs` driver supports the following properties:\n\n* `path`   - The directory to store the cached items;\n\nYou can watch for more examples on the examples/ directory.\n\n\n# Other configurations\n\n* `httpTimeout` - The number of milliseconds to wait for a request on the backend (defaults to 5000);\n* `httpTestTimeout` - The number of milliseconds to wait on a backend test request (defaults to 1000);\n* `httpMaxSockets` - The number of maximum open sockets for each backend (defaults to 256);\n* `backendWatchInterval`  - The number of milliseconds of interval to perform HTTP tests requests to backends with status `down`;\n* `backendSelector` - A function which permits to select the next active backend from a supplied list;\n* `cache` - An object containing the settings to be used for cache when just the string `'cache'` is used for backend;\n* `backends` - An array containing backend objects, URLs (as server backends) or the string `'cache'` as a cache backend using the `cache` configuration settings;\n* `errors` - An object containing an index of error codes, containing a `document` string and an `headers` object;\n\n\n# Run it!\n\n\t$ failoverproxy config_file --debug\n","created":"2015-07-31T11:36:32.348Z","modified":"2015-11-17T18:13:41.233Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"doliveira","email":"d.oliveira@prozone.org"},"owners":[{"name":"doliveira","email":"d.oliveira@prozone.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"failoverproxy","_npmUser":{"name":"doliveira","email":"d.oliveira@prozone.org"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.23","_rev":"1-0145cc4aeb385ad0f70a8b51ec822a54","_shasum":"5dcc4506bf207dd1334bed7461628dc6997ec276","author":{"name":"David Oliveira","email":"d.oliveira@prozone.org"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"5dcc4506bf207dd1334bed7461628dc6997ec276","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/failoverproxy/-/failoverproxy-0.1.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"doliveira","email":"d.oliveira@prozone.org"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-11-17T18:13:41.233Z","created":"2015-07-31T11:36:32.348Z","0.0.1":"2015-07-31T11:36:32.348Z","0.0.2":"2015-07-31T11:38:07.528Z","0.0.3":"2015-07-31T11:41:56.185Z","0.0.4":"2015-07-31T12:40:02.648Z","0.0.5":"2015-07-31T12:43:37.911Z","0.0.6":"2015-07-31T12:48:39.473Z","0.0.7":"2015-07-31T13:14:54.784Z","0.0.8":"2015-07-31T14:00:41.093Z","0.1.0":"2015-07-31T14:43:10.667Z","0.1.2":"2015-11-17T18:13:41.233Z"}}}
