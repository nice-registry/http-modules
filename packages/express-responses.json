In the template, Responses will expose an `http` object in `res.locals` containing an object like the following:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"code\": 404,\n\t\"status\": \"not found\",\n\t\"message\": \"User chris not found.\"\n}\n```\n\nIf the request does not accept HTML or `view` is not set, Responses will return this object via `res.json(data)`. In either case, `res.status` will be appropriately called.\n\n### emit Function\n\nIf the `emit` option is set with a function accepting an Error, any errors sent with Responses will also be passed to the function. This is useful for debugging and logging.\n\nOnly errors with status codes 500 and above will be passed to `emit` when `process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production'` as 5xx series errors are the fault of the server. In development, any error will be emitted to the `emit` function.\n\n## Contributing\n\nObviously, there are a lot more HTTP error codes. I have only implemented the ones I have been using daily. If you can justify the use case for new methods, open an issue or pull request (new methods are really just one liners).\n\nWe can always have more tests: if you find a bug, create an issue or be **fabulous** and fix the problem and write the tests up yourself in a coherent pull request.\n\nRun tests with the `npm test` command.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ndrejewski) for updates or just for the lolz and please check out my other [repositories](https://github.com/andrejewski) if I have earned it. I thank you for reading.\n\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-07-04T16:28:47.649Z","modified":"2015-11-20T16:42:33.717Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"andrejewski","email":"chrisishereladies@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"andrejewski","email":"christopher.andrejewski@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"express-responses","_nodeVersion":"4.1.2","_npmUser":{"name":"andrejewski","email":"chrisishereladies@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.4","_rev":"1-1e0ee318f0f99db2b98d7b367d8228d8","_shasum":"c1de9f6f06446003966aa17cada20ee0246bcdee","author":{"name":"Chris Andrejewski","email":"christopher.andrejewski@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/andrejewski/express-responses/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"c1de9f6f06446003966aa17cada20ee0246bcdee","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/express-responses/-/express-responses-1.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"andrejewski","email":"christopher.andrejewski@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-11-20T16:42:33.717Z","created":"2015-07-04T16:28:47.649Z","1.0.0":"2015-07-04T16:28:47.649Z","1.1.0":"2015-07-10T02:00:14.372Z","1.2.0":"2015-11-20T16:42:33.717Z"},"users":{"dmoraschi":true}}}
