Then you need [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm), node's package manager.\n\nOnce you're all set, to install globally, run:\n\n    $ npm install http-console -g\n\nIt'll download the dependencies, and install the command-line tool in `/usr/local/bin` \n(you may need to make use of `sudo` or equivalent to gain access).\n\n### Installing the bleeding edge #\n\nThe latest release will often be available on npm as `http-console@latest`, so you can run:\n\n    $ npm install http-console@latest\n\nAlternatively, you can download a tarball of this repo, or clone it. Just make sure you have\nthe latest version of node.\n\nintroduction\n------------\n\nLet's assume we have a [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) instance running locally.\n\n### connecting #\n\nTo connect, we run `http-console`, passing it the server host and port as such:\n\n    $ http-console 127.0.0.1:5984 \n\n### navigating #\n\nOnce connected, we should see the *http prompt*:\n\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/>\n\nserver navigation is similar to directory navigation, except a little simpler:\n\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> /logs\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/logs> /46\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/logs/46> ..\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/logs> ..\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/>\n\n### requesting #\n\nHTTP requests are issued with the HTTP verbs *GET*, *PUT*, *POST*, *HEAD* and *DELETE*, and\na relative path:\n\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> GET /\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Date: Mon, 31 May 2010 04:43:39 GMT\n    Content-Length: 41\n\n    {\n        couchdb: \"Welcome\",\n        version: \"0.11.0\"\n    }\n\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> GET /bob\n    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\n    Date: Mon, 31 May 2010 04:45:32 GMT\n    Content-Length: 44\n\n    {\n        error: \"not_found\",\n        reason: \"no_db_file\"\n    }\n\nWhen issuing *POST* and *PUT* commands, we have the opportunity to send data too:\n\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> /rabbits\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/rabbits> POST\n    ... {\"name\":\"Roger\"}\n\n    HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n    Location: http://127.0.0.1/rabbits/2fd9db055885e6982462a10e54003127\n    Date: Mon, 31 May 2010 05:09:15 GMT\n    Content-Length: 95\n\n    {\n        ok: true,\n        id: \"2fd9db055885e6982462a10e54003127\",\n        rev: \"1-0c3db91854f26486d1c3922f1a651d86\"\n    }\n\nMake sure you have your `Content-Type` header set properly, if the API requires it. More\nin the section below.\n\n> Note that if you're trying to POST to a form handler, you'll most probably want to send data\nin `multipart/form-data` format, such as `name=roger&hair=black`. http-console sends your POST/PUT data *as is*,\nso make sure you've got the format right, and the appropriate `Content-Type` header.\n\n### setting headers #\n\nSometimes, it's useful to set HTTP headers:\n\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> Accept: application/json\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> X-Lodge: black\n\nThese headers are sent with all requests in this session. To see all active headers,\nrun the `.headers` command:\n\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> .headers\n    Accept: application/json\n    X-Lodge: black\n\nRemoving headers is just as easy:\n\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> Accept:\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> .headers\n    X-Lodge: black\n\nBecause JSON is such a common data format, http-console has a way to automatically set\nthe `Content-Type` header to `application/json`. Just pass the `--json` option when\nstarting http-console, or run the `.json` command:\n\n    $ http-console 127.0.0.1:5984 --json\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> .headers\n    Accept: */*\n    Content-Type: application/json\n\n### cookies #\n\nYou can enable cookie tracking with the `--cookies` option flag.\nTo see what cookies are stored, use the `.cookies` command.\n\n### SSL #\n\nTo enable SSL, pass the `--ssl` flag, or specify the address with `https`.\n\n### quitting #\n\n    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> .q\n\nnuff' said.\n\n\n\n","starsCount":8,"created":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","modified":"2017-03-17T14:58:06.287Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"cloudhead","email":"self@cloudhead.net"},"owners":[{"name":"cloudhead","email":"self@cloudhead.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-console","_nodeVersion":"6.8.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/http-console-0.6.4.tgz_1476664063712_0.4481862692628056"},"_npmUser":{"name":"cloudhead","email":"self@cloudhead.net"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"2-ba6ac80924cef5f94f2a99bb3351e992","_shasum":"1e601c233a15b991d7f456339ebb339ab2ddd5d8","author":{"name":"Alexis Sellier","email":"self@cloudhead.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/cloudhead/http-console/issues"},"contributors":[],"directories":{"lib":"./lib","test":"./test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.6.4","stable":"0.5.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"1e601c233a15b991d7f456339ebb339ab2ddd5d8","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-console/-/http-console-0.6.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cloudhead","email":"self@cloudhead.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-17T14:58:06.287Z","created":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.1.0":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.1.1":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.1.2":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.2.0":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.2.1":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.2.2":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.2.3":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.2.4":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.2.5":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.3.0":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.3.1":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.3.2":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.3.3":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.3.4":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.4.0":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.5.0":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.5.1":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.6.0":"2011-01-26T19:50:27.555Z","0.6.1":"2011-07-18T14:02:48.871Z","0.6.2":"2012-07-31T12:09:42.230Z","0.6.3":"2015-05-02T18:06:27.025Z","0.6.4":"2016-10-17T00:27:45.281Z"},"users":{"fgribreau":true,"finalclass":true,"kastor":true,"tunnckocore":true,"sel":true,"jasoncmcg":true,"oleynikd":true,"prjioz":true}}}
