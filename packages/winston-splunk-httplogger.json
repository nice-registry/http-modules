Takes the following configuration:\n\n * **config:** configuration settings for the `SplunkStreamEvent` instance\n * **config.splunk:** the `Splunk Logger` settings\n * **config.splunk.token:** the Splunk HTTP Event Collector token\n * **[config.level=info]:** logging level to use, will show up as the `severity`\n   field of an event\n * **[config.splunk.source=winston]:** the source for the events sent to Splunk\n * **[config.splunk.sourcetype=winston-splunk-logger]:** the sourcetype for the\n   events sent to Splunk\n * **[config.splunk.host=localhost]:** the Splunk HTTP Event Collector host\n * **[config.splunk.maxRetries=0]:** how many times to retry the splunk logger\n * **[config.splunk.port=8088]:** the Splunk HTTP Event Collector port\n * **[config.splunk.path=/services/collector/event/1.0]:** URL path to use\n * **[config.splunk.protocol=https]:** the protocol to use\n * **[config.splunk.url]:** URL string to pass to `url.parse`. This will try to\n   set `host`, `path`, `protocol`, `port`, `url`. Any of these values will be\n  overwritten if the corresponding property is set on `config`\n * **[config.splunk.eventFormatter]:** formats events, returning an event as a\n   string, `function(message, severity)`\n * **[config.batchInterval=0]:** automatically flush events after this many\n   milliseconds. When set to a non-positive value, events will be sent one by\n   one. This setting is ignored when non-positive\n * **[config.maxBatchSize=0]:** automatically flush events after the size of\n   queued events exceeds this many bytes. This setting is ignored when\n   non-positive\n * **[config.maxBatchCount=1]:** automatically flush events after this many\n   events have been queued. Defaults to flush immediately on sending an\n   event. This setting is ignored when non-positive\n\n## Configuring Splunk\n\n  1. Log into your Splunk instance as an Administrator\n  2. Go to Settings &gt; Data Inputs\n  3. Click on HTTP Event Collector under Local inputs\n  4. Click on New Token\n  5. Walk through the wizard to configure your new HTTP Event Collector\n\nSplunk will provide you with a token at the end of the wizard.  You need to insert that\ntoken into the splunk object you use to create the SplunkStreamEvent() object.  In the\nexample above, this is done by placing the token in the SPLUNK_TOKEN environment variable.\n\n## See Also\n\n  * [HTTP Event Collector]\n  * [Splunk logging for JavaScript]\n\n[Winston]: https://github.com/winstonjs/winston\n[Splunk]: http://www.splunk.com\n[HTTP Event Collector]: http://dev.splunk.com/view/event-collector/SP-CAAAE6M\n[Splunk logging for JavaScript]: https://github.com/splunk/splunk-javascript-logging\n","created":"2015-12-11T05:36:01.457Z","modified":"2017-05-27T19:44:21.600Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"photoadrian","email":"adrian@shellmonger.com"},"owners":[{"name":"photoadrian","email":"adrian@shellmonger.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"winston-splunk-httplogger","_nodeVersion":"7.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/winston-splunk-httplogger-1.2.2.tgz_1495914261504_0.8796832128427923"},"_npmUser":{"name":"photoadrian","email":"adrian@shellmonger.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.2.0","_rev":"4-03163b56ec5c0e6bd55a5e7a12b5dcf3","_shasum":"fc48d7369b5be786b2a85b305ccf87588f28298c","author":{"name":"Adrian Hall","email":"adrian@shellmonger.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/adrianhall/winston-splunk-httplogger/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"fc48d7369b5be786b2a85b305ccf87588f28298c","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/winston-splunk-httplogger/-/winston-splunk-httplogger-1.2.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"photoadrian","email":"adrian@shellmonger.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-27T19:44:21.600Z","created":"2015-12-11T05:36:01.457Z","1.0.0":"2015-12-11T05:36:01.457Z","1.0.1":"2015-12-11T06:09:32.617Z","1.1.0":"2015-12-11T22:11:48.414Z","1.2.0":"2017-05-25T14:38:42.718Z","1.2.1":"2017-05-27T19:39:11.661Z","1.2.2":"2017-05-27T19:44:21.600Z"}}}
