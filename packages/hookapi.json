For example, one may try to watch, trace, or monitor every http calls when the program runs. \r\nHowever, this is extremely difficult as http module, (or fs module) etc are down at system level and it is hard to monitor at run time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This module tries to fill the gap to allow developers the ability to hook into the any module (system or user module) to perform some custom functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Install</h2>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>$ npm install hookapi\r\nor get it from the github\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>Usage &amp; Examples</h2>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>hookapi.cmd HOOKING_FILE.js [app.js]\r\n\r\nTo hook *ANY* http calls, \r\ninvoke the following commands from console:\r\n\r\n    hookapi.cmd httptrace.js testhttp.js\r\n    testhttp.js can be your app.js\r\n\r\nand then the result is:\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><em>*</em> HOOKED http.request =>http://www.google.com/index.html\r\nGot response: 302</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How it works</h2>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>hookapi works by hooking exported functions of any module. So it requires that that module MUST be loaded BEFORE first use (or require).\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>TODO</h2>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>* make use of require.resolve \r\nto support same name with different module\r\n\r\n* solving hooking sequence issues\r\nfor example, https uses http's which may also be hooked by something else\r\n\r\n* more useful utilities and or examples\r\n</code></pre>\r\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2013-09-12T11:01:00.860Z"}],"created":"2013-09-12T11:00:52.272Z","modified":"2013-09-12T11:01:00.860Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"softguy","email":"softguyus@yahoo.com"},"owners":[{"name":"softguy","email":"softguyus@yahoo.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"hookapi","_npmUser":{"name":"softguy","email":"softguyus@yahoo.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.5","_rev":"1-8c662892679c42118bf18fc00e27d600","author":{"name":"softguy","email":"softguyus@yahoo.com"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"63e8f7b42bf2e2db012a6967384d5168dfe5d815","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hookapi/-/hookapi-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"softguy","email":"softguyus@yahoo.com"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.html","time":{"modified":"2013-09-12T11:01:00.860Z","created":"2013-09-12T11:00:52.272Z","0.1.0":"2013-09-12T11:01:00.860Z"}}}
