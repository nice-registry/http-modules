Install homebridge using: npm install -g homebridge\n2. Install this plugin using: npm install -g homebridge-http-luminescence\n3. Update your configuration file. See sample-config.json in this repository for a sample.\n\n# Configuration\n\n\nConfiguration sample file:\n\n ```\n \"accessories\": [\n     {\n         \"accessory\": \"HttpLuminescence\",\n         \"name\": \"Ambient Light Level\",\n         \"url\": \"http://192.168.0.20/luminescence?format=json\",\n         \"http_method\": \"GET\"\n     }\n ]\n\n```\n\n\nThe defined endpoint will return a json looking like this\n```\n{\n\t\"lightlevel\": 150\n}\n```\n\n\nThis plugin acts as an interface between a web endpoint and homebridge. You will need additional hardware to expose the web endpoints with the light level information. I built my Temperature, Humidity and Light Sensor on the NodeMCU board with Arduino IDE.\n","created":"2017-01-07T01:06:49.536Z","modified":"2017-01-07T01:50:31.546Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"crashtestoz","email":"projects@candco.com.au"},"owners":[{"name":"crashtestoz","email":"projects@candco.com.au"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"homebridge-http-luminescence","_nodeVersion":"7.4.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/homebridge-http-luminescence-1.1.5.tgz_1483753831307_0.24522643955424428"},"_npmUser":{"name":"crashtestoz","email":"projects@candco.com.au"},"_npmVersion":"4.0.5","_rev":"9-0775046b48b2812125f622275960bd1e","_shasum":"9e54493d62d8b5916f871c0db3bc79810ed67924","author":{"name":"Peter Chodyra","email":"projects@candco.com.au"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/crashtestoz/homebridge-http-luminescence/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.5"},"dist":{"shasum":"9e54493d62d8b5916f871c0db3bc79810ed67924","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/homebridge-http-luminescence/-/homebridge-http-luminescence-1.1.5.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"crashtestoz","email":"projects@candco.com.au"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-07T01:50:31.546Z","created":"2017-01-07T01:06:49.536Z","1.0.0":"2017-01-07T01:06:49.536Z","1.0.1":"2017-01-07T01:13:27.639Z","1.0.2":"2017-01-07T01:18:22.349Z","1.1.0":"2017-01-07T01:28:18.808Z","1.1.1":"2017-01-07T01:30:53.960Z","1.1.2":"2017-01-07T01:39:57.434Z","1.1.3":"2017-01-07T01:45:18.482Z","1.1.4":"2017-01-07T01:48:28.962Z","1.1.5":"2017-01-07T01:50:31.546Z"}}}
