It is supported both by React Native for Android and iOS and is a HTML spec - so it works both for web and desktop. Yet, for web and desktop, the fetch API won't handle requests to other domains. For these cases, you can use `reactors-http-request`.\n\nIt will then use `superagent`. We try to add as much support as possible to various cases such as streaming or cache handling.\n\n# Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save reactors-http-request\n```\n\n# Usage\n\n```javascript\nrequest(url: string, options?: Object)\n```\n\n```javascript\nimport request from 'reactors-http-request';\n\nasync function createNewFoo(url, foo) {\n  const res = await request(url, {method: 'POST', payload: foo});\n  const {ok, body, error} = res;\n  return ok ? body : error;\n}\n```\n\n# HTTP Methods\n\n```javascript\nrequest(url, {method: 'POST', payload: {foo: 1}});\n```\n\n# Headers\n\nYou can set headers as such:\n\n```javascript\nrequest(url, {headers: {['X-HEADER']: 'foo'}});\n```\n\n# JSON detection\n\nJSON is detected for both requests (so you don't need to set the Content-Type header) and for responses (so you don't need to parse the text - it is already in JSON).\n","created":"2016-06-27T03:22:31.578Z","modified":"2016-07-18T01:30:23.185Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"francoisv","email":"francoisrvespa@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"francoisv","email":"francoisrvespa@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"reactors-http-request","_nodeVersion":"5.0.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/reactors-http-request-0.0.4.tgz_1468805421539_0.6684515548404306"},"_npmUser":{"name":"francoisv","email":"francoisrvespa@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"1-7faaf3e03bc826e9f3a6e2fc0879401c","_shasum":"41913ec44fe0447aa1ad208aaac042225dae09f4","author":"","directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"41913ec44fe0447aa1ad208aaac042225dae09f4","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/reactors-http-request/-/reactors-http-request-0.0.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"francoisv","email":"francoisrvespa@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-07-18T01:30:23.185Z","created":"2016-06-27T03:22:31.578Z","0.0.2":"2016-06-27T03:22:31.578Z","0.0.3":"2016-06-29T23:35:11.141Z","0.0.4":"2016-07-18T01:30:23.185Z"}}}
