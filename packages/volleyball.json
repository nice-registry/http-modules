It optionally supports the [`debug`](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#readme) module.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLogging HTTP cycles can be approached in several ways, each with its own drawbacks:\n\n* Log only upon **request**. Drawback: we cannot log the corresponding response, which happens later (if at all).\n* Log only upon **response**, attaching the request. Drawback A: if the server never sends a response, e.g. due to a bug, the request will not be logged either. Drawback B: two temporally distinct events are conflated, misleadingly.\n* Log both upon **request** and **response**. Drawback: it is not necessarily clear which responses are for which requests.\n\nVolleyball takes the last approach, and assigns randomly-generated ids to label request-response pairs. It is designed for student project development, teaching beginning programmers how HTTP servers and asynchronicity work. It may also be useful as a low-configuration debug tool.\n\n## Usage\n\n### `volleyball`\n\nThe `volleyball` module can be used directly as demonstrated in the first example. The module defaults to using `process.stdout` for output.\n\n### `volleyball.custom(config)`\n\nA customized logging middleware can be generated by calling `custom` with a configuration object:\n\n```js\nconst logger = volleyball.custom({ debug: true }) // default namespace 'http'\n// const logger = volleyball.custom({ debug: 'custom-namespace' })\n// const logger = volleyball.custom({ debug: debugInstance })\n\napp.use(logger)\n```\n\nThe `debug` property logs using the [`debug`](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#readme) module. It supports the following values:\n\nvalue | result\n----|----\n`true` | uses a new debug instance with a default namespace of `'http'`\nstring | uses a new debug instance with a custom namespace\nfunction | uses any function, such as a pre-generated debug instance. Note that the function will be called with colorized strings.\n\n## Related and Alternatives\n\nFor more powerful, configurable, and compatible logging needs, check out:\n\n* [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#readme)\n* [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan#readme)\n* [morgan-debug](https://github.com/ChiperSoft/morgan-debug#readme)\n* [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#readme)\n* [express-winston](https://github.com/bithavoc/express-winston#readme)\n* [node-bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan/#readme)\n","created":"2016-08-15T00:47:55.167Z","modified":"2016-10-14T16:43:50.172Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"glebec","email":"glebec@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"glebec","email":"glebec@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"volleyball","_nodeVersion":"6.6.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/volleyball-1.4.1.tgz_1476463428302_0.9616564174648374"},"_npmUser":{"name":"glebec","email":"glebec@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"1-fd7d836d11114dcec522f1e2c9b972ea","_shasum":"3f9c2113638a79aa7e3b6536e9049ce901993d10","author":{"name":"Gabriel Lebec","email":"glebec@gmail.com","url":"https://github.com/glebec"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/glebec/volleyball/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.4.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"3f9c2113638a79aa7e3b6536e9049ce901993d10","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/volleyball/-/volleyball-1.4.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"glebec","email":"glebec@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-10-14T16:43:50.172Z","created":"2016-08-15T00:47:55.167Z","1.0.0":"2016-08-15T00:47:55.167Z","1.1.0":"2016-08-15T01:32:16.490Z","1.1.1":"2016-08-15T03:00:35.250Z","1.1.2":"2016-08-15T20:18:04.080Z","1.2.0":"2016-08-17T06:07:25.655Z","1.2.1":"2016-08-21T08:22:04.858Z","1.3.0":"2016-08-22T07:01:35.338Z","1.4.0":"2016-10-14T16:09:17.250Z","1.4.1":"2016-10-14T16:43:50.172Z"}}}
