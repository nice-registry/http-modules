If the code\nis not in the 200 range, the response will be thrown instead.\n\n```js\nvar fetch = require('fetch-one');\n\nfetch('GET', 'https://google.com', { q: 'peace' }, {\n\t'X-Progress': 'Half way there'\n});\n\nfetch('POST', 'http://example', {\n\tfield: 'value',\n\tnested: {\n\t\tfield: 'value',\n\t},\n})\n```\n\nI just needed something simple that worked in both environments and without a\nlot of bells and whistles. It is probably inadequate for most other use cases\nthan mine.\n\nI hope it will some day be replaced by a \"universal\" version of the new fetch\nAPI.\n","created":"2015-11-14T15:20:36.043Z","modified":"2016-09-18T20:37:52.700Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"thomas-jensen","email":"thomas@src.agency"},"owners":[{"name":"thomas-jensen","email":"thomas@src.agency"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"fetch-one","_nodeVersion":"6.5.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/fetch-one-0.6.3.tgz_1474231070795_0.7067705993540585"},"_npmUser":{"name":"thomas-jensen","email":"thomas@src.agency"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.5","_rev":"1-6969a9655dfe8b2855b2715fc48e5e23","_shasum":"fecc86e23cf39df04cacd92cda0c5082120bf9da","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/srcagency/fetch-one/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.6.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"fecc86e23cf39df04cacd92cda0c5082120bf9da","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/fetch-one/-/fetch-one-0.6.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"thomas-jensen","email":"thomas@src.agency"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-09-18T20:37:52.700Z","created":"2015-11-14T15:20:36.043Z","0.1.0":"2015-11-14T15:20:36.043Z","0.2.0":"2015-12-08T14:23:49.623Z","0.3.0":"2016-01-04T13:20:20.189Z","0.4.0":"2016-02-15T11:28:21.106Z","0.5.0":"2016-02-16T12:34:52.761Z","0.6.0":"2016-02-16T16:18:35.945Z","0.6.1":"2016-02-16T16:21:18.739Z","0.6.2":"2016-05-06T16:35:57.686Z","0.6.3":"2016-09-18T20:37:52.700Z"}}}
