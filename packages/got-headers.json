Uses GET HTTP method (or whatever method requested) rather than HEAD as some servers may not support HEAD, or not use cookies with HEAD etc.\n\nReturns a [Bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) Promise which resolves to the response object, or rejects with an error.\n\nUses [got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got) to make the HTTP request.\n\n### headers(url, [options])\n\n```js\nconst headers = require('got-headers');\n\nheaders('http://www.google.com').then(function(res) {\n\t// Print headers object\n\tconsole.log(res.headers);\n}).catch(function(err) {\n\t// Print error\n\tconsole.log('Error!', err);\n\n\t// Print response object\n\tconsole.log(err.res);\n});\n```\n\n`options` object is passed directly to [got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got) - use any of got's options.\n\n## Tests\n\nUse `npm test` to run the tests. Use `npm run cover` to check coverage.\n\nThere are no tests at present but it seems to work fine!\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [changelog.md](https://github.com/overlookmotel/got-headers/blob/master/changelog.md)\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you discover a bug, please raise an issue on Github. https://github.com/overlookmotel/got-headers/issues\n\n## Contribution\n\nPull requests are very welcome.
