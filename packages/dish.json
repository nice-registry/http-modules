Be sure to set a `Content-Type`\n  header if you are serving a string or buffer.\n- `status` (Number) - status code for the response, defaults to `res.statusCode` or 200.\n\n### Middleware example\n\n```js\nvar dish = require('dish')\n  , middler = require('middler')\n  , server = require('http').createServer()\n\nmiddler(server)\n  // a simple \"about us\" page\n  .get('/about', dish.file('./about.html'))\n  // Serve a dynamic javascript file with gzip support:\n  .get('/my-code.js', function (req, res, next) {\n    // create some dynamic javascript...\n    var myCode = 'var myNumber = ' + Math.random();\n    // serve it\n    dish(myCode, {headers: {'Content-Type': 'text/javascript'}})(req, res);\n  });\n\nserver.listen(3000);\n```\n\n### Tweaking the LRU cache\n\nBy default, dish uses a 256 MB LRU cache to transparently cache files.\n\n- To clear a single cache entry, use `dish.clearCache(filepath)`.\n- To clear all cache entries, use `dish.clearCache()`.\n- To set cache options, such as `max` bytes, use `dish.cache.setOptions(options)`.\n  Supports options that [lru-cache](https://www.npmjs.org/package/lru-cache) supports.\n- To access the cache directly (an [lru-cache](https://www.npmjs.org/package/lru-cache)\n  instance), use `dish.cache.backend`.\n- To disable the cache, use `dish.cache.setOptions({max: 0})`\n\n```\n\n\n- - -\n\n### Developed by [Terra Eclipse](http://www.terraeclipse.com)\nTerra Eclipse, Inc. is a nationally recognized political technology and\nstrategy firm located in Aptos, CA and Washington, D.C.\n\n- - -\n\n### License: MIT\n\n- Copyright (C) 2012 Carlos Rodriguez (http://s8f.org/)\n- Copyright (C) 2012 Terra Eclipse, Inc.
