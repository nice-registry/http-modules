Older versions provide compatibility with Node 0.8 (Uptime v3.1) and 0.6 (Uptime v1.4).\n\nTo install from GitHub, clone the repository and install dependencies using `npm`:\n\n```sh\n$ git clone git://github.com/springerpe/uptime.git\n$ cd uptime\n$ npm install\n```\n\nLastly, start the application with:\n\n```sh\n$ node app\n```\n\nIf you want a production environment:\n\n```sh\n$ NODE_ENV=production node app\n```\n\nUpgrading From a 2.0 Install\n----------------------------\n\nIf you have been using uptime 1.0 or 2.0, you have to execute the migration script before using the new release.\n\n```sh\n$ node models/migrations/upgrade2to3\n```\n\nAdding Checks\n-------------\n\nBy default, the web UI runs on port 8082, so just browse to \n\n    http://localhost:8082/\n\nAnd you're ready to begin. Create your first check by entering an URL, wait for the first ping, and you'll soon see data flowing through your charts!\n\nConfiguring\n-----------\n\nUptime uses [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) to allow YAML configuration and environment support. Here is the default configuration, taken from `config/default.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nurl:        'http://localhost:8082'\n\nmongodb:\n  server:   localhost\n  database: uptime\n  user:     root \n  password:\n  connectionString:       # alternative to setting server, database, user and password separately\n\nmonitor:\n  name:                   origin\n  apiUrl:                 'http://localhost:8082/api' # must be accessible without a proxy\n  pollingInterval:        10000      # ten seconds\n  timeout:                5000       # five seconds\n  userAgent:              NodeUptime/2.0 (https://github.com/springerpe/uptime)\n\nanalyzer:\n  updateInterval:         60000      # one minute\n  qosAggregationInterval: 600000     # ten minutes\n  pingHistory:            8035200000 # three months\n\nautoStartMonitor: true\n\nplugins:\n  - ./plugins/console\n  - ./plugins/patternMatcher\n  - ./plugins/httpOptions\n  # - ./plugins/email\n```\n\nTo modify this configuration, create a `development.yaml` or a `production.yaml` file in the same directory, and override just the settings you need. For instance, to run Uptime on port 80 in production, create a `production.yaml` file as follows:\n\n```yaml\nurl: 'http://myDomain.com'\n```\n\nNode that Uptime works great behind a proxy - it uses the `http_proxy` environment variable transparently.\n\nArchitecture\n------------\n\nUptime is composed of two services: a webapp (in `app.js`), and a polling monitor (in `monitor.js)`. For your convenience, the two services start together when you call `node app`.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/springerpe/uptime/downloads/architecture.png\" title=\"Uptime architecture\" />\n\nHowever, heavily browsing the webapp may slow down the whole server - including the polling monitor. In other terms, using the application can influence the uptime measurements. To avoid this effect, it is recommended to run the polling monitor in a separate process.\n\nTo that extent, set the `autoStartMonitor` setting to `false` in the `production.yaml`, and launch the monitor by hand:\n\n```sh\n$ node monitor &\n$ node app\n```\n\nDon't forget to set `NODE_ENV=production` if you want to run the app in production environment.\n\nYou can also run the monitor in a different server. This second server must be able to reach the API of the webapp server: set the `monitor.apiUrl` setting accordingly in the `production.yaml` file of the monitor server.\n\nMonitoring From Various Locations\n---------------------------------\n\nYou can even run several monitor servers in several datacenters to get average response time. In that case, make sure you set a different `monitor.name` setting for all monitor servers to be able to tell which server make a particular ping.\n\nUsing Plugins\n-------------\n\nPlugins can add more notification types, more poller types, new routes to the webapp, etc. Uptime currently bundles three plugins:\n\n * [`console`](https://github.com/springerpe/uptime/blob/master/plugins/console/index.js): log pings and events in the console in real time\n * [`email`](https://github.com/springerpe/uptime/blob/master/plugins/email/index.js): notify events (up, down pause) by email\n * [`patternMatcher`](https://github.com/springerpe/uptime/blob/master/plugins/patternMatcher/index.js): allow HTTP & HTTPS pollers to test the response body against a pattern\n * [`httpOptions`](https://github.com/springerpe/uptime/blob/master/plugins/httpOptions/index.js): add custom HTTP options and headers to HTTP and HTTPS checks (e.g. to allow self-signed certificate on HTTPS, custom headers, custom HTTP methods, ...)\n * [`basicAuth`](https://github.com/springerpe/uptime/blob/master/plugins/basicAuth/index.js): add HTTP Basic Access Authentication to the dashboard and API applications\n\nTo enable plugins, just add a line to the `plugins:` section of the configuration file.\nThree of the bundled plugins are already enabled by default:\n\n```yaml\n# in config/default.yaml\nplugins:\n  - ./plugins/console\n  - ./plugins/patternMatcher\n  - ./plugins/httpOptions\n  # - ./plugins/email\n  # - ./plugins/basicAuth\n```\n\nYou can override these settings in your environment configuration, for instance:\n\n```yaml\n# in config/production.yaml\n# disable the console plugin and enable the email plugin\nplugins:\n  # - ./plugins/console\n  - ./plugins/patternMatcher\n  - ./plugins/httpOptions\n  - ./plugins/email\n  # - ./plugins/basicAuth\n```\n\nThird-party plugins:\n\n * [`webhooks`](https://github.com/mintbridge/uptime-webhooks): notify events to an URL by sending an HTTP POST request \n * [`campfire`](https://gist.github.com/dmathieu/5592418): notify events to Campfire\n * [`pushover`](https://gist.github.com/xphyr/5994345): Notify events to mobile devices\n\nWriting Plugins\n---------------\n\nA plugin is a simple Node.js module which hooks into predefined extension points. Uptime automatically requires plugin modules when starting the webapp and the monitor, and tries to call the two following functions:\n\n* `initWebApp(options)` when starting the webapp\n* `initMonitor(options)` when starting the monitor\n\nCheck the [app.js](https://github.com/springerpe/uptime/blob/master/app.js#L97) and [monitor.js](https://github.com/springerpe/uptime/blob/master/monitor.js#L8) to see a detail of the options passed to each hook. Also, check the code of existing plugins to understand how they can add new pollers, new notification types, etc.\n\nFor instance, if you had to recreate a simple version of the `console` plugin, you could write it as follows:\n\n```js\n// in plugins/console/index.js\nvar CheckEvent = require('../../models/checkEvent');\nexports.initWebapp = function() {\n  CheckEvent.on('afterInsert', function(checkEvent) {\n    checkEvent.findCheck(function(err, check) {\n      console.log(new Date() + check.name + checkEvent.isGoDown ? ' goes down' : ' goes back up');\n    });\n  });\n}\n```\nAll Uptime entities emit lifecycle events that you can listen to on the Model class. These events are `beforeInsert`, `afterInsert`, `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate`, `beforeSave` (called for both inserts and updates), `afterSave` (called for both inserts and updates), `beforeRemove`, and `afterRemove`. For more information about these events, check the [mongoose-lifecycle](https://github.com/fzaninotto/mongoose-lifecycle) plugin.\n\nAPI\n---------------\n\nAll API requests should be prefixed with `api`.\nThe API response always uses the `application/json` mimetype.\nAPI requests do not require authentication.\n\nExample of a valid API request:\n\n`GET http://example.com/api/checks`\n\nExample for a valid API request using curl :\n\n`curl -i -H \"Accept: application/json\" -X PUT -d \"name=example\" -d \"url=http://mysite.com\" -d \"interval=120\" http://example.com/api/checks`\n\n### Status codes\n\nThe API is designed to return different status codes :\n\n* `200 Ok` : The request was successful, the resource(s) itself is returned as JSON\n* `400 Bad Request` : An attribute of the API request is invalid or missing (e.g. the url of a check is missing)\n* `404 Not Found` : A resource could not be accessed (e.g. a check ID could not be found)\n* `500 Server Error` : Something went wrong on the server side (e.g. a check could not be saved in database)\n\n### CRUD routes\n\n#### `GET /checks`\n\nReturn a list of all checks\n\n#### `GET /checks/needingPoll`\n\nReturn a list of checks that need a poll (i.e. not paused, plus new or last tested > interval set between tests)\n\n#### `GET /checks/:id`\n\nReturn a single check\n\nParameter :\n\n* `id` : (required) Id of the check\n\nEx: `http://localhost:8082/api/checks/527a25bdc9de6e0000000004`\n\n#### `GET /checks/:id/pause`\n\nToggle the status (isPaused) of a check\n\nParameter :\n\n* `id` : (required) Id of the check\n\nEx: `http://localhost:8082/api/checks/527a25bdc9de6e0000000004/pause`\n\n#### `PUT /check/:id/test`\n\nUpdates the last checked date for a check.
