You can select one of `json`, `text` and `xml` by using the `responseType` option:\n\n```javascript\nHttp.get({\n    url: \"/foo\",\n    responseType: \"xml\"\n});\n```\n\n### Request types\n\nBy default, `form-urlencoded` is used. You can select one of `form-urlencoded`, `text` and `json` by using the `contentType` option:\n\n```javascript\nHttp.post({\n    url: \"/foo\",\n    contentType: \"json\",\n    body: {\n        foo: \"bar\"\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Cross Origin Resource Sharing, a.k.a. CORS, with cookies\n\nNOTE: Only works if the browser supports CORS.\n\n```javascript\nHttp.get({\n    url: \"/foo\",\n    crossOrigin: \"use-credentials\"\n});\n```\n\n### Custom Headers\n\n```javascript\nHttp.get({\n    url: \"/foo\",\n    headers: {\n        \"X-My-Header\": \"bar\"\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Changing Promises Implementation\n\nBy default, http.js uses ES6 promises. You can either use them with the [polyfill](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise), or plug your favorite Promises/A+ implementation in:\n\n```javascript\n// Kris Kowal's Q\nHttp.PromiseImplementation = Q;\n\n// RSVP\nHttp.PromiseImplementation = RSVP.Promise;\n```\n\n### Errors\n\nhttp.js rejects its requests with three kind of errors:\n\n#### HttpError\n\nThis error is triggered if the server responds with a status code other than 2xx.\n\n##### Properties\n\n* `type` (string): This is always set to `HttpError`.\n* `message` (string): This is something like `GET <url> failed with status 404`.\n* `statusCode` (number): The response status code the server returned.\n* `headers` (object): The response headers the server returned.\n* `body`: (any): The response body the server returned.\n\n#### ResponseError\n\nThis error is triggered if the response from the server could not be successfully processed.\n\n##### Properties\n\n* `type` (string): This is always set to `ResponseError`.\n* `message` (string): This is something like `GET <url> failed with status 404`.\n* `statusCode` (number): The response status code the server returned.\n* `headers` (object): The response headers the server returned.\n* `body`: (any): The response body the server returned.\n\n\n#### NetworkError\n\nThis error is triggered if no response is available. Possible reasons:\n\n* Connection to server could not be established.\n* Connection timed out.\n* Server did not respond.\n* Server doesn't support CORS for this endpoint.\n\n##### Properties\n\n* `type` (string): This is always set to `NetworkError`.\n* `message` (string): This is something like `GET <url> failed with status due to a network error (missing CORS headers?)`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are most welcome! If you're having problems and don't know why, search the issues to see if someone's had the same issue. If not, file a new issue so we can solve it together and leave the solution visible to others facing the same problem as well. If you find bugs, file an issue, preferably with good reproduction steps. If you want to be totally awesome, you can make a PR to go with your issue, containing a new test case that fails currently!\n\n### Development\n\nDevelopment is pretty straightforward, it's all JS and the standard node stuff works:\n\nTo install dependencies:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\nTo run the tests:\n\n```bash\n$ npm test\n```\n\nThen just make your awesome feature and a PR for it. Don't forget to file an issue first, or start with an empty PR so others can see what you're doing and discuss it so there's a a minimal amount of wasted effort.\n\nDo note that the test coverage is currently a whopping 100%. Let's keep it that way! Remember: if it's not in the requirements specification (i.e. the tests), it's not needed, and thus unnecessary bloat.\n","created":"2014-06-04T20:51:46.509Z","modified":"2014-06-13T09:07:14.581Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jussi-kalliokoski","email":"jussi.kalliokoski@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"jussi-kalliokoski","email":"jussi.kalliokoski@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"http-js","_npmUser":{"name":"jussi-kalliokoski","email":"jussi.kalliokoski@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.14","_rev":"1-10853f4b79d879b958ffc034c1f59252","_shasum":"93dc2334e741b60b4310cd5bfe03fbd305fa5b56","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jussi-kalliokoski/http.js/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"93dc2334e741b60b4310cd5bfe03fbd305fa5b56","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/http-js/-/http-js-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jussi-kalliokoski","email":"jussi.kalliokoski@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-06-13T09:07:14.581Z","created":"2014-06-04T20:51:46.509Z","0.0.0":"2014-06-04T20:51:46.509Z","0.0.1":"2014-06-13T09:07:14.581Z"}}}
