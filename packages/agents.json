It's so stupidly simple that you could probably write this yourself.\n\n##Usage:\n\n```bash\nnpm install node-user-agents\n```\n\n```JavaScript\nvar request = require('request')\n\t, agents = require('agents');\n\nrequest({'uri':'wikipedia.org','headers':{'User-Agent':agents.randomAgentString()}},function(error,response,body){\n\tconsole.log(body);\n});\n//See? It's like taking candy from a baby.\n```\n## Working use cases:\n\n- Scripting HTTP requests to Wikipedia (has terrible bot detection)\n- Any other site that isn't as big as Google to be able to invest in super-smart bot-detection systems.\n\n\n## Non-working use cases:\n\n- Google (based on IP address and no more than 20 requests in a minute)\n\n","created":"2012-10-14T19:15:29.193Z","modified":"2015-03-03T16:51:54.795Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ericjang","email":"ericjang2004@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"ericjang","email":"ericjang2004@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"agents","_nodeVersion":"0.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"ericjang","email":"ericjang2004@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.6.1","_rev":"1-1f59bcb4dbe9c83e2123a9871c076e6f","_shasum":"796bbc3619b463502c2a944c6726365454b9fc4b","author":{"name":"Eric Jang"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ericjang/node-user-agents/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"796bbc3619b463502c2a944c6726365454b9fc4b","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/agents/-/agents-0.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ericjang","email":"ericjang2004@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-03-03T16:51:54.795Z","created":"2012-10-14T19:15:29.193Z","0.0.1":"2012-10-14T19:15:29.627Z","0.0.2":"2015-03-03T16:51:54.795Z"}}}
