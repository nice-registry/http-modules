Two engines are built-in:\none that validates the incoming requests against the blueprint (`linear-check`),\nand one that doesn't and just blindly replies with the consecutive response\n(`linear`). The former is the default.\n\n\n## Built-in engines\n\nThese two engines will look at\n\n* the request's cookie `katt_scenario` to decide which scenario to focus on\n(e.g. basename of the scenario)\n* the request's cookie `katt_transaction` to decide the request to match against\nand which response is suitable (defaults to 0)\n\nBoth engines will automatically set a response header `Set-Cookie` in order\nto advance the transaction count.\n\nThe `linear-check` engine can have the validation turned off temporarily via a\nrequest header `X-KATT-Dont-Validate`.\n\nYou can see an example [here](test/katt-player-fixtures.coffee#L55).\n\n\n## Custom engines\n\nCustom engines may be implemented in order to add support for dealing with KATT\nrecall structures, for example.\n\nThere are no restrictions or requirements at all.\n\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n# NPM distribution\nnpm install katt-player\n\n# GIT source\ngit clone --recurse-submodules [THIS_REPO_URL]\nnpm install\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\nkatt-player [--engine=linear] [--port=1337] FOLDER      # default engine is linear, port is 1337\nkatt-player [--engine=linear] [--port=1337] FILE1 FILE2 # accepts blueprints as well\nkatt-player --engine=path/to/engine.js FOLDER           # use a custom engine\nNODE_ENV=development katt-player FOLDER                 # enable logging to console, instead of console.log\n```\n\n```coffee\nkattPlayer = require 'katt-player'\napp = kattPlayer kattPlayer.engines.linear\napp.load 'FOLDER', 'FILE1', 'FILE2'\napp.listen 1337\n```\n\n\n## License\n\n[Apache 2.0](LICENSE)\n\n\n  [1]: https://travis-ci.org/klarna/katt-player\n  [2]: https://travis-ci.org/klarna/katt-player.png\n","versions":[{"number":"0.2.3","date":"2013-09-05T11:07:05.475Z"}],"created":"2013-09-05T11:07:02.289Z","modified":"2013-09-05T11:12:12.676Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"andreineculau","email":"andrei.neculau@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"andreineculau","email":"andrei.neculau@gmail.com"},{"name":"isakb","email":"isak.bakken@gmail.com"},{"name":"uliedberg","email":"ulf@liedberg.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"katt-player","_npmUser":{"name":"andreineculau","email":"andrei.neculau@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.2.18","_rev":"1-0c2160c728ef114921956de12601b325","contributors":[{"name":"Andrei Neculau","email":"andrei.neculau@klarna.com"},{"name":"Isak Bakken","email":"isak@klarna.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"4bd0c0730cd532affc69959557fedc098709b149","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/katt-player/-/katt-player-0.2.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"andreineculau","email":"andrei.neculau@gmail.com"},{"name":"isakb","email":"isak.bakken@gmail.com"},{"name":"uliedberg","email":"ulf@liedberg.org"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2013-09-05T11:12:12.676Z","created":"2013-09-05T11:07:02.289Z","0.2.3":"2013-09-05T11:07:05.475Z"}}}
