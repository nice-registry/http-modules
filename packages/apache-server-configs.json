This is usually the recommended\nway, as using `.htaccess` files [slows\ndown](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html#when)\nApache!\n\nIf you don't have access, which is quite common with hosting services,\njust copy the [`.htaccess`](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/blob/master/dist/.htaccess)\nfile in the root of the website.\n\nAlso note that some configurations won't have any effect if the\nappropriate modules aren't enabled. So, in order for everything\nto work as intended, you need to ensure the you have the following\nApache modules [enabled](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/wiki/How-to-enable-Apache-modules):\n  * [`mod_autoindex.c` (autoindex_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_autoindex.html)\n  * [`mod_deflate.c` (deflate_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_deflate.html)\n  * [`mod_expires.c` (expires_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_expires.html)\n  * [`mod_filter.c` (filter_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_filter.html)\n  * [`mod_headers.c` (headers_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html)\n  * [`mod_include.c` (include_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_include.html)\n  * [`mod_mime.c` (mime_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_mime.html)\n  * [`mod_rewrite.c` (rewrite_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html)\n  * [`mod_setenvif.c` (setenvif_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_setenvif.html)\n\nFor more detailed information on configuration files and how to\nuse them, please check the appropriate Apache documentation:\n\n* https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/configuring.html\n* https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html\n\n\n## Support\n\n* #### __Apache v2.2.0+__\n\n* #### __Browsers:__\n\n  * Chrome\n  * Firefox 4+\n  * Internet Explorer 8+\n  * Opera 12+\n  * Safari 5+\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nAnyone and everyone is welcome to contribute, but before you do,\nplease take a moment to review the [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n* [Bug reports](CONTRIBUTING.md#bugs)\n* [Feature requests](CONTRIBUTING.md#features)\n* [Pull requests](CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n[Apache Server Configs](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/) is\nonly possible thanks to all the awesome\n[contributors](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/graphs/contributors)!\n\n\n## License\n\nThe code is available under the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2014-08-03T11:04:19.566Z","modified":"2015-04-07T20:51:34.162Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"alrra","email":"alrraa@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"alrra","email":"alrraa@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"apache-server-configs","_nodeVersion":"0.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"alrra","email":"alrraa@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.7.5","_rev":"1-613417fdeb82e66935172fc6cee5b0b3","_shasum":"c68363fb7532b19934a87855a93ca442710eb7a5","author":{"name":"The H5BP Team"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.14.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"c68363fb7532b19934a87855a93ca442710eb7a5","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/apache-server-configs/-/apache-server-configs-2.14.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"alrra","email":"alrraa@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-04-07T20:51:34.162Z","created":"2014-08-03T11:04:19.566Z","2.7.0":"2014-08-03T11:04:19.566Z","2.7.1":"2014-08-03T11:09:24.438Z","2.8.0":"2014-09-13T10:59:00.715Z","2.9.0":"2014-10-15T12:42:59.042Z","2.10.0":"2014-10-20T14:33:20.655Z","2.11.0":"2014-10-26T22:47:12.458Z","2.12.0":"2015-03-02T21:44:20.395Z","2.13.0":"2015-03-04T13:50:43.512Z","2.14.0":"2015-04-07T20:51:34.162Z"},"users":{"fdeneux":true,"porreh":true}}}
