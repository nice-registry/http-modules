In your [Gulp-based mbed.js project](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-js-example), run:\n\n    ```\n    $ npm install mbed-js-http --save\n    ```\n    \n1. Install the native library:\n\t\n    ```\n    $ cd node_modules/mbed-js-http\n    $ mbed add $(cat mbed-http.lib)\n    $ cd ../..\n    ```\n\n1. Clear your build directory:\n\n    ```\n    $ rm -r build/out\n    ```\n\n1. Use the library via:\n\n    ```js\n    var network = /* get a network connection from somewhere... See below. */\n\n    var get = HttpRequest(network, http_method.HTTP_GET, 'http://httpbin.org/status/418');\n\tvar gres = get.send();\n\n    print(\"Status is \" + gres.status_code());\n    ```\n\n## Getting a network connection\n\nSee [ARMmbed/mbed-js-easy-connect](https://github.com/armmbed/mbed-js-easy-connect).\n\n## HTTPS\n\nThis library does not support HTTPS right now. The underlying library (mbed-http) however *does*. I've left it out right now because:\n\n* HTTPS requires mbed TLS, which is relatively big, especially when combining it with JerryScript.\n* It cannot be linked out when not using it (as in C++).\n\nIf you want HTTPS:\n\n* Change `#include http_request.h` into `#include https_request.h`.\n* Rename all `HttpRequest` instances to `HttpsRequest`.\n* Note that the constructor for the JS object changes, so you'll need to do a little work there (one extra parameter).\n\n## Todo\n\n* `send()` is synchronous. Should not be synchronous.\n* Header allocation should be on the heap. Now the lib often runs out of stack memory when reading the headers.\n","created":"2017-02-27T14:45:49.288Z","modified":"2017-03-03T10:00:59.020Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"janjongboom1","email":"janjongboom@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"janjongboom1","email":"janjongboom@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"mbed-js-http","_nodeVersion":"7.0.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/mbed-js-http-1.0.2.tgz_1488535256920_0.7002148150932044"},"_npmUser":{"name":"janjongboom1","email":"janjongboom@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"3-d39c8c65f6de82de2e6b1e6d0b01b36e","_shasum":"9998a7435637d2b525f3cb9450b390c89e3b363f","author":{"name":"Jan Jongboom","email":"jan.jongboom@arm.com"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"9998a7435637d2b525f3cb9450b390c89e3b363f","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/mbed-js-http/-/mbed-js-http-1.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"janjongboom1","email":"janjongboom@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-03T10:00:59.020Z","created":"2017-02-27T14:45:49.288Z","1.0.0":"2017-02-27T14:45:49.288Z","1.0.1":"2017-02-27T14:53:54.923Z","1.0.2":"2017-03-03T10:00:59.020Z"}}}
