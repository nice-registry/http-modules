This package was inspired in [hapi-method-override](https://github.com/ubaltaci/hapi-method-override).\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/moliveraf/hapi-overriding.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/moliveraf/hapi-overriding)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/moliveraf/hapi-overriding/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/moliveraf/hapi-overriding?branch=master)\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\n$ npm install hapi-overriding\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n**hapi-overriding** works by extending the `onRequest` step of the request lifecycle. The extension function checks, for any incoming POST request, if the path ends with one of the defined action names (e.g. `destroy`). If so, it will change the method to the corresponding HTTP verb (e.g. `DELETE`). It will also change the url of the request, removing the action part and keeping your routes clean.\n\n## Example\n\nClient-side:\n```html\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"/users/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011/destroy\">\n  <button type=\"submit\">Delete user</button>\n</form>\n```\n\nServer-side:\n```javascript\nvar Hapi = require('hapi');\nvar server = new Hapi.Server();\n\nserver.connection({ port: 3000 });\n\nserver.register(require('hapi-overriding'), function(err) {\n\n  if (err) {\n    throw err;\n  }\n\n  server.route({\n    method: 'DELETE',\n    path: '/users/{id}',    // No `/destroy` at the end!\n    handler: function (request, reply) { ... }\n  });\n\n  server.start();\n});\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThe action names may be customized by passing the following options when registering the plugin:\n\n- `put` - the action that represents the PUT verb. Defaults to `update`.\n- `delete` - the action that represents the DELETE verb. Defaults to `destroy`.\n","created":"2015-04-02T07:42:03.975Z","modified":"2016-01-04T23:07:46.797Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"matioli","email":"m@matioli.me"},"owners":[{"name":"olistic","email":"moliverafreire@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"hapi-overriding","_nodeVersion":"0.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"matioli","email":"m@matioli.me"},"_npmVersion":"2.5.1","_rev":"1-200c5cede414d5a2d9f27f44b2db6bf9","_shasum":"c61eaa62a26091f57f214211e258278ca3b2efb0","author":{"name":"Matias Olivera","email":"m@matioli.me"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/moliveraf/hapi-overriding/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"c61eaa62a26091f57f214211e258278ca3b2efb0","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hapi-overriding/-/hapi-overriding-0.1.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"olistic","email":"moliverafreire@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-01-04T23:07:46.797Z","created":"2015-04-02T07:42:03.975Z","0.1.1":"2015-04-02T07:42:03.975Z","0.1.3":"2015-04-02T13:51:47.881Z","0.1.4":"2015-04-04T17:17:48.383Z"}}}
