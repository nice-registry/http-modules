Basic development grammar, please visit Website https://github.com/yangyxu/zeanium. It is back-end solution for node.js. Provide `cache`、`cli`、`database`、`io`、`net`、`parser`、`session`、`template` module.\n\nIt's back-end mvc framework, provide integrated solutions.\n\n```bash\n$ npm install zeanium-node -g\n```\n\nNode.js >= 5.0.0 required.\n\n## Features\n\n- Http server base\n- Plugin customization\n- Dynamic development & deployment\n    >This is very important feature, developer don't need restart http server when develop mode or release mode. If you do any change for project, the system will auto reload the newly code.\n- Using event queue to solve asynchronous\n- Support promise\n- Support middleware\n- Support SQL transaction\n- Support some Class(Model, Controller) inherit.\n- Customize model(M)&view(V)&controller(C)\n- Customize http handler router\n\n## Docs & Community\n\n- [Website && Documentations](https://www.zeanium.com)\n-
