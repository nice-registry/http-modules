This module automatically knows which status code and message to send according the error passed.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst http = require('http')\nconst send = require('response-error')\n\n\nhttp.createServer((request, response) => {\n  try {\n    // some code here\n  } catch (e) {\n    send(response, e)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis module accept all native errors (ReferenceError, TypeError, etc) as well as [HttpError](https://github.com/jshttp/http-errors). You also can\npass a status code directly as following:\n\n```js\nsend(response, 404)\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\nnpm install response-error --save\n```\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/response-error.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/response-error/)\n\n\n## Question\n\nFor support, bug reports and or feature requests please make sure to read our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tether/contribution-guide/blob/master/community.md\" target=\"_blank\">community guidelines</a> and use the issue list of this repo and make sure it's not present yet in our reporting checklist.\n\n## Contribution\n\nThe open source community is very important to us.
